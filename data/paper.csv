219410769,bb8b66c38c55bd078cdb34444f7d622130f61c56,Practice with people experiencing homelessness: an analysis of secondary traumatic stress in the workplace,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bb8b66c38c55bd078cdb34444f7d622130f61c56,"ABSTRACT People experiencing homelessness often present to social service providers with trauma histories. As they seek services, their service providers may be secondarily exposed to their clients’ trauma, thereby impacting the level of care these service providers are able to offer. Unfortunately, little research examines the stress burden carried by homelessness service providers, nor the factors that contribute to their stress burden. The purpose of this mixed methods study, therefore, is to characterize the secondary traumatic stress (STS) reported by individuals who provide direct services to people experiencing homelessness, and to explore the workplace experiences that may underlie, influence, or mitigate this stress. The study relies upon a sample of direct service providers and program managers who work with people experiencing homelessness. The authors collected data on STS and workplace stress via a web-based survey (n = 122) and focus group interviews (n = 21). The results of this study suggest that homelessness service providers carry a substantial stress burden. Findings further point towards administrative strategies that may improve service providers’ stress burdens, and potentially improve the service quality provided by agencies serving homeless populations.",0

Other than well-known herpetic retinopathies like acute retinal necrosis, progressive outer retinal necrosis and cytomegalovirus retinitis, there are few reports on atypical forms of viral retinitis caused by herpes virus from around the world.


CASES
Presenting symptom was sudden onset of diminution of vision in all 6 cases. Mean duration of symptoms at presentation was 7.6 days. The mean age was 27.3 years (range 22-40 years). All were immunocompetent (4 females and 2 males), with unremarkable review of system. All had unilateral involvement. Presenting visual acuity ranged from CFCF to 6/60. Granulomatous anterior uveitis was present in 4 cases. All had focal retinitis with irregular margins, either juxtapapillary, macular or over one of the major vascular arcades. The diagnosis of focal viral retinitis was made solely based upon the clinical findings. All recovered after a course of oral acyclovir (one was given additional intravitreal acyclovir as well) and oral prednisolone, with final visual acuity of 6/6P to 6/9 in all except one.


CONCLUSION
In case of focal retinitis with irregular margin, viral etiology should be borne in mind. Clinical features are typical enough to help in diagnosing without PCR test.",0

Central venous catheterization (CVC) is an indispensable route of venous access in management of critically ill patients. Potential CVC related complications include mechanical and infectious complications.


OBJECTIVE
To determine type, incidence and risk factor of CVC related complications in pediatric patients.


MATERIAL AND METHOD
Prospective observational study of all patients who underwent CVC in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, over a 1-year period.


RESULTS
The study included 137 patients, of whom 63.5% were males. The mean age was 36.7 ± 4.4 months. There were 204 CVC attempts with total indwell time of 2,002 days. The rate of mechanical complication was 19%, including failure to place catheter (9.3%), hematoma (4.9%), arterial puncture (2%) and pneumothorax (1.5%). Patient body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2, internal jugular venous catheterization, and longer insertion time (> 30 minutes) were associated with high mechanical complication rates. The incidence density of catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI) was 7.5/1,000 catheter-days. Femoral vein placement had significant higher incidence of CRBSI.


CONCLUSION
CVC related complications are comparable to previous studies. Risk factors of mechanical complications include high BMI, internal jugular venous catheterization and longer insertion time. Femoral venous catheterization is the only risk factor for CRBSI.",0

The proposed design consists of concentric decagons, and open-ended microstrip lines etched on the circular substrate. The proposed design features a uniform and fairly strong electric field distribution in the nearfield region. In addition, this antenna exhibits impedance matching ranging from 902 MHz - 925 MHz and further poses low gain characteristics, that is required for most of the nearfield application in order to avoid misreading of other tags. Moreover, this design provides symmetric current distribution throughout the structure, thereby solves orientation sensitivity problems of low-cost linearly polarised tag antennas. The measurement results demonstrate tag can successfully read expensive jewellery items, tagged pills and tag placed in different orientations. Therefore, the proposed reader antenna is a good candidate for near field RFID, health care and IoT Applications.",0

In this article, the authors examine prescription weight-loss medications and related dental considerations for oral health care professionals (OHCPs). The authors focus on the most common prescription weight-loss drugs and their potential interactions with medications frequently used in dental practice, and they include recommendations for modification in patient care.


METHODS
The authors reviewed the literature regarding interactions between weight-loss drugs and medications commonly used in dentistry, including patient-treatment considerations. They also address the interactions of greatest clinical concern that have a high-quality evidence-based foundation in either randomized controlled clinical trials or meta-analyses.


CONCLUSIONS
Dental treatment can be performed and medications commonly used in dentistry can be administered safely to patients taking orlistat, an inhibitor of fat absorption. The same may not be true, however, for other weight-loss medications that modify the central nervous system neurotransmission of norepinephrine, dopamine or serotonin. OHCPs should be aware of the potential theoretical and pharmacokinetic risks relative to the actual clinical and reported risks for hypertension and cardiotoxicity in particular.


PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
Recognition and avoidance of potential weight-loss drug interactions, especially those with medications commonly used in dentistry, can help clinicians optimize patient treatment while emphasizing patient safety.",0

The endometriosis fertility index was developed to predict the fertility outcomes in patients who underwent surgery for endometriosis. Finally, the American Association of Gynecological Laparoscopists classification is currently being developed, for which 30 endometriosis experts are analyzing and researching data by assigning scores to categories considered important; however, it has not yet been fully validated and published.

By analyzing the specificity and function of these cells we can gain insights into the human immune response to pathogens and vaccines, identify correlates of protection, and isolate neutralizing antibodies and protective T cells. To interrogate human memory B cell and plasma cell repertoires we developed 2 culture-based high-throughput methods that are used to isolate, with high efficiency, human monoclonal antibodies of distinctive specificities. Unusually potent neutralizing antibodies against human cytomegalovirus were isolated from infected donors and used to identify the viral ligands and to design an experimental vaccine. We also isolated antibodies of exceptional breadth, such as a pan-influenza A neutralizing antibody and an antibody that neutralizes both respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus. By targeting conserved structures, these broadly neutralizing antibodies are less prone to select escape mutants and are therefore promising candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of infections as well as tools for the design of improved subunit vaccines.",0

The methods used in the analytical examples to calculate each component impedance and admittance can be modified without change to the demonstrated loop based formulation. This applies even if more advanced techniques are developed to calculate these components.

Based on the experimental data, we developed a kinetic mathematical model that describes the metabolic and energetic changes in growing bakers' yeast when exposed to a specific temperature upshift. The model includes the temperature dependence of core energy‐conserving pathways, trehalose synthesis, protein synthesis and proteolysis. Because our model focuses on protein synthesis and degradation, the net result of which is important in determining the cell's capacity to grow, the model includes growth, i.e. glucose is consumed and biomass and adenosine nucleotide cofactors are produced. The model reproduces both the observed initial metabolic response and the subsequent relaxation into a new steady‐state, compatible with the new ambient temperature. In addition, it shows that the energy consumption for proteome reprofiling may be a major determinant of heat‐induced growth arrest and subsequent recovery or cell death.",0

Results: In asthma model group, the concentrations of RAGE and IL-4 in the serum and BALF were obviously higher than those in control group [(494±32) vs (327±45) ng/L; (32.4±5.8) vs (13.1±2.9) ng/L; (553±38) vs (399±56) ng/L; (37.8±3.4) vs (19.4±2.5) ng/L] (all P<0.01); in Roxithromycin group, the concentrations of RAGE and IL-4 in the serum and BALF were obviously lower than those in asthma model group [(438±18) vs (494±32) ng/L; (22.8±6.0) vs (32.4±5.8) ng/L; (444±42) vs (553±38) ng/L; (25.6±4.5) vs (37.8±3.4) ng/L] (all P<0.05). In asthma model group, the bronchial wall was thickened, the lumen was narrow, the mucosal wrinkles were significantly increased, edema appeared under the mucosa, and a large number of inflammatory cells infiltrated and aggregated in the bronchi, perivascular and alveolar spaces; the thickness of airway wall and airway smooth muscle were significantly increased than those in control group (P<0.01); in Roxithromycin group, airway inflammation and remodeling were alleviated compared with those in asthma model group (P<0.05). In asthma model group, the expression of RAGE in lung tissues were significantly increased than those in control group (P<0.01); in Roxithromycin group, the expression of RAGE were significantly decreased than those in asthma model group (P<0.01). There were positive correlations between the expression of RAGE and IL-4 in BALF and serum (r=0.782, 0.804, all P<0.01); there were positive correlations between RAGE and total white cell counts, eosinophil counts, smooth muscle thickness (r=0.897, 0.927, 0.860, all P<0.01). Conclusions: The increasing of RAGE in asthmatic rats are positively correlated with airway inflammation and airway remodeling. Roxithromycin may inhibit the development of asthma by reducing the expression of RAGE.",0

The 00‐rapeseed meal (00‐RSM) is the developed variety of rapeseed with reduced GLS and erucic acid content through genetic selection. The present study was conducted with the objective of comparing the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) in 00‐RSM and RSM when fed to growing broilers. Three samples of each ingredient were collected from different sources. Two hundred and fifty two day‐old male broilers (Hubbard × Hubbard) were fed a corn‐soybean meal based starter diet in crumble form from day 1 to 13. On day 14, all chicks were individually weighed and randomly distributed to 42 replicate pens (6 birds in each pen). Six test diets (2 ingredient × 3 samples) with approximately 20% crude protein were made in mash form in such a way that the 6 test ingredients served as the sole source of AA in one diet. The endogenous AAs (EAA) were determined by feeding a nitrogen‐free diet to six replicate pens. Each test diet was fed to six replicates of broiler chicks from 14 to 21 days of age. Results indicated that the SID of all AA differed (P < 0.001) among 00‐RSM samples. Among RSM samples, the SID of AA varied for arginine, methionine (P < 0.01), histidine, leucine, lysine, aspartic acid, and phenylalanine (P < 0.05). A greater (P < 0.05) SID of all AA except arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, cysteine, and glutamic acid was observed in 00‐RSM compared with RSM. In conclusion, 00‐RSM had greater SID of AA compared with RSM and it is nutritionally superior to RSM to be used in broiler diets.",0

The electrophysiologic study demonstrated the presence of four atrio-ventricular accessory pathways with antegrade conduction (left lateral, right posteroseptal, right midseptal and right posterolateral). After ablation of the fourth accessory pathway, the electrocardiogram showed a persistent delta wave with a short HV interval. Atrial stimulation demonstrated decremental conduction, progressive lengthening of the AH interval and no modification in the HV interval nor in the preexcitation pattern, suggestive of the presence of a fasciculo-ventricular fiber.

It was shown that the new monosubstance reproterol, a phenylethyl-aminoalkyl-xanthine, is a very potent bronchodilator whose effect persists for at least 6 h. This bronchlysis could be proven on the basis of total and specific airways resistance as having a significantly superior and longer-lasting effect when compared with placebo. Also, when compared with orciprenaline the total broncholytic effect (areas of Raw and SRaw for effect covering time) was significantly better. No essential cardiovascular or subjective side-effects were caused by any of the three preparations inhaled in from of an aerosol equipped with metering valve.

Evans Memorial Lecturer. When I completed my postgraduate studies of chemistry in the laboratories of Professor Gilbert N. Lewis, I was offered a position as a research associate in Dr. Evans's Institute of Experimental Biology. That began my association with Professor Evans from 1938 to 1949. During this period, I was introduced to the field of endocrinology and learned the importance of biology in chemical research. I am grateful to Dr. Evans for that opportunity. Since 1950, the structures of more than 25 hormonally active peptides and proteins have been determined in addition to a number of tissue hormones. Many of these have also been synthesized in the laboratory. These advances could not have been achieved without the isolation of these hormones in pure form. Methods of isolating these polypeptides depend greatly upon the development of techniques in protein chemistry. Thus, contributions made by A. Tiselius, L. C. Craig, and others have given tremendous impetus to the recent progress in this phase of hormone research. Bayliss and Starling [1] discovered secretin in 1902, and they defined the term ""hormone"" as a ""chemical messenger."" It took nearly 65 years to isolate secretin in pure form; its structure was finally determined by Mutt and Jorpes [2]. In contrast, from the discovery of calcitonin in 1961 by Copp [3] to the determination of its structure and total synthesis in 1968 [4, 5] took only 7 years. A new era in the history of protein hormones began with the discovery of insulin by Banting, Best, and Macleod in 1922 [6], its crystallization by Abel in 1926 [7], and its structure determination by Sanger in 1954 [8].",0

While more and more scientific research of bioelectromagnetic phenomena is focusing on bioeffects of exposure to non-ionizing UWB pulses, characterization of those effects is far from complete. In this paper, a synthesis of experimental studies from the point of computational modeling is presented. The complexity of the experiments requires a numerical rather than an analytical approach. Solving Maxwell’s equations using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a necessary step in visualizing and understanding broadband response. The advantages of this method include having almost no limits in the description of geometrical and dispersive properties of the simulated material, numerical robustness, and appropriateness for the computer technology of today. Some of the results of the computation and their importance in future experimental design are discussed. Improvements in the computational modeling and dielectric material description are suggested. This paper aims at justifying a scientific basis for UWB exposure safety standards relevant for setting the non-ionizing UWB radiation exposure guidelines. The results of this research will be of interest to people who work with electronic devices involving UWB radiation.",0

To obtain a specific antagonist of CXCR4, SDF-1P2G54 by mutating SDF-1 second proline (P) into glycin (G) and removing the α-helix of its C-terminal.


METHODS
SDF-1p2g54 gene amplified by PCR was inserted into the vector pET-30a (+) and transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain BL21. After IPTG induction of E. coli, the expressed recombinant protein was purified with nickel-affinity chromatography column under denaturing conditions and refolded with gradient dilution and ultra-filtration. The chemotactic effect of SDF-1P2G54 on Jurkat cells and its antagonistic effect against SDF-1 were determined by transwell assay; flow cytometry was used to assay the ability of SDF-1P2G54 to induce calcium influx and CXCR4 internalization in MOLT4 cells.


RESULTS
The recombinant protein SDF-1P2G54 completely lost the functions to activate CXCR4 or to induce transmembrane migration of Jurkat cells and calcium influx in MOLT4 cells, but maintained a high affinity to CXCR4. SDF-1P2G54 effectively inhibited the chemotactic effect of wild-type SDF-1 to Jurkat cells, and induced rapid CXCR4 internalization in MOLT4 cells.


CONCLUSION
SDF-1P2G54 is a new antagonist of CXCR4 with a potential value as an effective inhibitor of HIV-1 infection, cancer metastasis or other major diseases.",0

This scheme is a primitive that allows a semi-trusted entity called the “proxy” to convert the signcryption addressed to a “delegator” to those that can be de-signcrypted by a “delegatee”, by using some special information given by the delegator, called “rekey”. In the scheme, the proxy is not allowed to know the secret keys of the delegator or the delegatee, or the plaintext during the conversion. The proxy and delegatee, however, are not allowed to collude with each other. Compared to the existing scheme, the proxy re-signcryption proposed by us implements the full conversion—a signcryption under the keys for two parties can be transferred to another signcryption under another different two keys, and the verification of the signcryption can be progressed without the participation of plaintext. Meanwhile, the security of the scheme is proved under the ROM. Finally, we give the analysis of the efficiency, performance and the function of the scheme, which proves that the function of our scheme is stronger and more perfect than that of the existing schemes.",0

Yet there is little data on how the pharmacological burden progressed over time among older individuals with COPD. We aimed to: 1) describe the proportion of older adults with COPD in Quebec, Canada, that were exposed to polypharmacy (≥10, ≥15 or ≥20 medications/year) between 2000 and 2015; 2) calculate the proportion of individuals receiving specific prescriptions for COPD during this period. We conducted a population-based cohort study with the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System. Individuals aged ≥66 years with COPD and covered by the universal public drug plan were included. We calculated the total number of drugs used at least once by each individual during each of the studied years, and used age-standardized proportions to compare proportions of users between the years. The average number of drugs used increased from 12.0 in 2000 to 14.8 in 2015. The proportion of individuals exposed to polypharmacy increased (≥10 drugs: 62.0% to 74.6%;≥15 drugs: 31.2% to 45.4%; ≥20 drugs: 12.3% to 22.4%). The proportion of individuals receiving long-acting bronchodilators increased from 18.7% in 2000 to 69.6% in 2015. The use of short-acting bronchodilators decreased from 81.5% to 67.9%, and that of inhaled corticosteroids from 60.6% to 26.0%. The proportion of users of methylxanthines decreased from 15.0% to 1.9%. Older individuals with COPD are increasingly exposed to polypharmacy.

The application of PDMS-Br@PNIPAAm micromolds in soft lithographic fabrication of ceramic microcomponents is demonstrated by producing alumina green microcomponents. The PDMS-Br@PNIPAAm micromolds are hydrophobic with a water contact angle of 129.7 ± 0.3° at 15 °C. During the molding process, the micromolds are changed to hydrophilic with a water contact angle of 81.3 ± 0.4° at 4 °C, which could improve the flowability of aqueous alumina slurry by forming intermolecular hydrogen bonding with PNIPAAm chains. During the demolding process, the micromolds are hydrophobic as the intermolecular hydrogen bonding is broken after drying. Consequently, free-standing alumina green microcomponents with microchannels of 73.7 ± 0.8 μm wide are fabricated by microtransfer molding, a maximum aspect ratio of 3.6 could be achieved. The lateral and longitudinal shrinkages of the microchannels are 9.8 ± 0.6% and 11.5 ± 0.4% respectively. The PDMS-Br@PNIPAAm micromolds can be reused more than 13 times. It is believed that moisture-sensitive PDMS-Br@PNIPAAm micromolds can be effectively used to fabricate ceramic microcomponents with high aspect ratios for MEMS.",0

The objectives of this study were, first, to perform a systematic and ultrastructural investigation of the initial mineral formation during secondary ossification center of mouse femur based on material science and biology viewpoint, and then develop novel biomaterials for mineralization based on the in vivo findings. First, we identified the very initial mineral deposition at postnatal day 5 (P5) at the medial side of femur epiphysis by nanocomputed tomography. Initial minerals were found in the surroundings of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Interestingly, histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed that initial mineralization until P6 was based on chondrocyte activity only, i.e., it occurred in the absence of osteoblasts. Moreover, electron microscopy-based ultrastructural analysis showed that cell-secreted matrix vesicles were absent in the early steps of osteoblast-independent endochondral ossification. Instead, chondrocyte membrane nanofragments were found in the fibrous matrix surrounding the hypertrophic chondrocytes. EDS analysis and electron diffraction study indicated that cell membrane nanofragments were not mineralized material, and could be the nucleation site for the newly formed calcospherites. The phospholipids in the cell membrane nanofragments could be a source of phosphate for subsequent calcium phosphate formation, which initially was amorphous, and later transformed into apatite crystals. Finally, artificial cell nanofragments were synthesized from ATDC5 chondrogenic cells, and in vitro assays showed that these nanofragments could promote mineral formation. Taken together, these results indicated that cell membrane nanofragments were the nucleation site for mineral formation, and could potentially be used as material for manipulation of biomineralization.",0

The manifestations, which are due to hypopigmentation, are confined to the eyes and optic pathway. OA1 associated with late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss was previously reported in a single family and hypothesized to be caused by a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving GPR143 and the adjacent gene, TBL1X. Here, we report on a family with OA1, infertility, late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss, and a small interstitial Xp microdeletion including the GPR143, TBL1X, and SHROOM2 genes. In addition, we re‐examined a patient previously described with OA1, infertility and a similar Xp deletion with audiologic follow‐up showing a late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss. Our results raise an intriguing question about the possibility for TBL1X (absence) involvement in this type of hearing loss. However, our study cannot claim a causative relationship and more convincing evidence is needed before the hypothesis can be accepted that TBL1X could be involved in late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss and that ocular albinism with late‐onset sensorineural hearing loss can present itself as a contiguous gene deletion/microdeletion syndrome. The finding of infertility in all affected male patients demonstrates that this deletion, including the SHROOM2 gene, may be a potentially causative X‐linked genetic factor of male infertility.",0

Traditional optimizers are cost-based and use statistical estimates of intermediate result cardinalities to assign costs and pick the best plan. However, such estimates tend to become less accurate because of filtering conditions caused either from undetected correlations between multiple predicates local to a single dataset, predicates with query parameters, or predicates involving user-defined functions (UDFs). Consequently, traditional query optimizers tend to ignore or miscalculate those settings, thus leading to suboptimal execution plans. Given the volume of today's data, a suboptimal plan can quickly become very inefficient. 
In this work, we revisit the old idea of runtime dynamic optimization and adapt it to a shared-nothing distributed database system, AsterixDB. The optimization runs in stages (re-optimization points), starting by first executing all predicates local to a single dataset. The intermediate result created from each stage is used to re-optimize the remaining query. This re-optimization approach avoids inaccurate intermediate result cardinality estimations, thus leading to much better execution plans. While it introduces the overhead for materializing these intermediate results, our experiments show that this overhead is relatively small and it is an acceptable price to pay given the optimization benefits. In fact, our experimental evaluation shows that runtime dynamic optimization leads to much better execution plans as compared to the current default AsterixDB plans as well as to plans produced by static cost-based optimization (i.e. based on the initial dataset statistics) and other state-of-the-art approaches.",0

However, the role of mitophagy in the bone impairment caused by Al is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/ E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2 (Parkin)-mediated mitophagy was activated in the bone impairment caused by Al in vivo. Then, the Al-induced mitophagy in Parkin-deficient mice and MC3T3-E1 cells were decreased. Meanwhile, Parkin deficiency exacerbated the bone impairment, mitochondrial damage, and oxidative stress under Al exposure, both in vivo and in vitro. In general, the results reveal that Al exposure can activate PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, and the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy plays a protective role in the bone impairment caused by Al.",0

Technological advances have motivated researchers to transition from traditional GC-IRMS to rapid, high-throughput laser-based instrumentation for N2 O isotopic research. However, calibrating laser-based instruments to yield accurate and precise isotope ratios has been an ongoing challenge. To streamline the N2 O isotope research pipeline, we developed the calibration protocol described here. While our approach is targeted for laboratory soil incubations, we anticipate that it will be broadly applicable for diverse types of stable isotope research.


METHODS
We prepared standards diluted from USGS52 and from a commercial cylinder to develop a calibration curve spanning from 0.3-300ppm N2 O. To calibrate over this broad range, we binned each isotopocule (N2 O, N15 NO, 15 NNO, and NN18 O) into low, medium, and high concentration ranges and then used mathematically similar polynomial functions to calibrate the isotopocules within each concentration range. We also assessed the temporal stability of the instrument and the capacity for our calibration approach to work with isotopically enriched gas samples.


RESULTS
Our calibration approach yielded generally accurate and precise data when isotopocules were calibrated in concentration ranges, and the measurements appeared to be temporally stable. For all isotopocules at natural abundance, the residual percentage error was smallest in the medium N2 O range. There was more noise in the corrected isotopomers and isotopologue at natural abundance in samples with the lowest and highest N2 O concentrations. Corrected isotopomers from isotopically enriched samples were very precise.


CONCLUSIONS
Developing our calibration strategy involved learning several key lessons: (1) calibrate isotopocules in distinct concentration ranges, (2) use mathematically similar models to calibrate the isotopocules in each range, (3) calibrated N2 O concentrations and δ values tend to be most accurate and precise in the medium N2 O range, and (4) we encourage users to take advantage of isotopic enrichment to capitalize on laser-based instrument strengths.",0

Differentially produced proteins included cochaperones, proteins associated with oxido‐reductase activities, and ubiquitin. Biochemical pathways to which these proteins belong were probed for their involvement in the resistance of both cell lines against cadmium toxicity. Among ER stressors, thapsigargin sensitized HZR cells, but not HeLa cells, to cadmium toxicity more acutely than tunicamycin, implying that these cells heavily relied on proper intracellular calcium distribution. The similar sensitivity of both HeLa and HZR cells to inhibitors of the proteasome, such as MG‐132 or lactacystin, excluded improved proteasome activity as a mechanism associated with zinc adaptation of HZR cells. The enzyme 4‐hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) was overproduced in HZR cells as compared to HeLa cells. It transforms HPP to homogentisate in the second step of tyrosine catabolism. Inhibition of HPPD decreased the resistance of HZR cells against cadmium, but not that of HeLa cells, suggesting that adaptation to zinc overload and increased HPP removal are linked in HZR cells.",0

Some of these species have great potential to become invasive if released or escaped from captivity. Here we studied the pet trade in a group of open countryside birds, the mynas (Acridotheres spp.) in Indonesia, and identified the areas that are at high risk of facing the establishment of these species. Mynas are among the most invasive birds in Southeast Asia. Once established in a new area, they are almost impossible to eradicate and can have strong negative impacts on the ecosystem. Preventing their introduction is therefore essential. Yet, invasive non-native mynas continue to be traded openly. We present data on the trade in seven species of mynas on Java, Bali and Lombok, with three species being native to parts of one or two of these islands, but not to the remainder, and four that are non-native to the region. From 2016 to 2021 we conducted 255 surveys of 30 animal markets. We recorded over 6000 mynas that were offered for sale outside their native range. Areas most at risk because of their high prevalence in specific animal markets, are Greater Jakarta, eastern Java, Bali and Lombok. The number of invasive non-native mynas recorded was positively related to the size of the animal market. Indonesia is signatory to several international agreements (CBD, ASEAN) that have policies and guidelines to prevent the introduction of invasive non-native species, but compliancy is weak. Annually hundreds and possibly thousands of invasive non-native mynas are released by Indonesian conservation authorities in regions that are outside their native range. Effective management of, and regulation of trade in, potential invasive non-native birds in Indonesia falls short and inadvertently greatly aids both their introduction and establishment.",0

Recently, power spatio-temporal big data (PSTBD) technology of smart grid based on mobile computing has experienced explosive growth. This paper emphasizes the specific requirements, technologies, applications, and challenges of the current PSTBD for mobile computing in smart grid. Based on current development status of PSTBD companies in representative countries in the world, we introduce PSTBD technology based on the characteristics of mobile computing based smart grid, and conduct a comprehensive investigation and analysis of relevant articles in this field. After comparing the differences between the traditional and the PSTBD based platform in the aspects of important features, platform goal, and platform architecture, we describe the key technologies and algorithms of the current PSTBD in detail. Then, based on the requirements of each link and field of the power grid, the typical application of PSTBD technology in various aspects of smart grid application based on mobile computing is discussed. Finally, the development direction and challenges of PSTBD are given. Through data analysis and technical discussion, it hopes to provide technical support and decision support for relevant practitioners in the PSTBD field.",0

One of the reasons for this is that there is a speed gap between the processor and main memory, known as the memory wall. A promising method to overcome this memory wall is aggressive out-of-order execution by extensively enlarging the instruction window resources to exploit memory-level parallelism (MLP). However, simply enlarging the window resources lengthens the clock cycle time. Although pipelining the resources solves this problem, it in turn prevents instruction-level parallelism (ILP) from being exploited because issuing instructions requires multiple clock cycles. This paper proposed a dynamic scheme that adaptively resizes the instruction window based on the predicted available parallelism, either ILP or MLP. Specifically, if the scheme predicts that MLP is available during execution, the instruction window is enlarged and the window resources are pipelined, thereby exploitingMLP. Conversely, if the scheme predicts that less MLP is available, that is, ILP is exploitable for improved performance, the instruction window is shrunk and the window resources are de-pipelined, thereby exploiting ILP. Our evaluation results using the SPEC2006 benchmark programs show that the proposed scheme achieves nearly the best performance possible with fixed-size resources. On average, our scheme realizes a performance improvement of 21% over that of a conventional processor, with additional cost of only 6% of the area of the conventional processor core or 3% of that of the entire processor chip. The evaluation results also show 8% better energy efficiency in terms of 1/EDP (energy-delay product). key words: microprocessor, superscalar processor, memory-level parallelism, instruction-level parallelism",0

Traditionally extramedullary osteosynthesis in form of dynamic hip screw (DHS) was treatment of choice for these fractures in past but recent trends are more in favors of intramedullary osteosynthesis as proximal femoral intramedullary nailing (PFN). Here we studied and compared the radiological and functional evaluation of treatment parameters of these fractures managed with both modalities of treatment. Methods: This prospective randomized study was conducted on 42 patients (21 patients in each group, group A, DHS; group B, PFN) with intertrochanteric fracture managed in two years of duration (July 2014 to June 2016). All the per-operative findings and complications were compared, while radiological assessment with radiographs and functional evaluation with Harris hip score was done at 1, 3 and 6 months post-operative follow-ups. Results: Mean age of patients were 56.14 years (range 25-84), and 56.19 years (range 28-80), in group A and B respectively. We observed that PFN had less mean blood loss (144 ml), less mean limb length shortening (0.5 cm) and gained better mean functional results at 6 months (Harris hip score, 86.9) due to early mobilization while patients managed with DHS had more blood loss (155 ml), more shortening (1.07 cm) and less functional outcomes at 6 months follow-up (scores, 77.2). Intra-operative radiation exposure was more in PFN group, while there was no significant difference in radiological union, neck-shaft angle and implant sliding in both groups. Conclusion: PFN was better than DHS in management of intertrochanteric fractures in terms of per-operative parameters (decreased blood loss, less complications), and as well as in functional outcomes (early weight bearing and mobilization, better Harris hip scores), while other parameters are not significantly different.",0

Muslim traders were sojourning along the shores of the Indonesian archipelago from at least the 8th century, and by the turn of the 14th century local Muslim communities had taken root, and the region’s first sultanate was established in northern Sumatra. Since then, Muslim communities had been established across many other parts of Southeast Asia, where in the 21st century they comprise demographic majorities in the nation-states of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei and significant minority populations in the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, and Singapore.
 The Islamization of these societies, and their inclusion into an expanding constellation of Muslim societies in the medieval and early modern periods, was facilitated by intensifications of activity along the maritime trading routes linking Southeast Asia to ports on the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Swahili Coasts with those of India and China over the medieval and early modern periods. Over the course of this history, the expansion of Islam in the region was not dominantly directed from any single source but rather the result of diverse, interlaced strands of commercial and cultural circulations that connected the region to multiple points in an expanding Muslim world—adopting local traditions to produce diverse and dynamic vernacular forms of Islamic cultural expression.",0

Psychotropic drugs may adversely affect work performance which depends on psychomotor activities. Both valproate and flunarizine are widely used drugs in prophylaxis of migraine and they are known to have effect on psychomotor performance. Hence this study was carried out to evaluate the effect of valproate & flunarizine on psychomotor performance in patients of migraine with the help of battery of subjective & objective psychomotor tests over a period of 8 weeks. 
Materials and Methods: Patients were allocated to one of the two groups on first day of examination. Baseline psychomotor tests were measured using battery of tests including critical flicker fusion test (CFFT), hand steadiness test (HST), arithmetic ability test & reaction time monitoring. At the end of 4 weeks & 8 weeks, again tests using same methods employed previously were performed. Efficacy was calculated by using Migraine dairy template (0, 4, 8 weeks) & CGI Scale (end). A total of 44 patients were recruited with 22 patients in each arm. 
Results: Flunarizine (n=20) & valproate (n=20) significantly increased CFFT, AAT scores at the end of 8 weeks compared to baseline and significantly reduced HST, RT, Frequency, Duration and severity at the end of 8 weeks compared to baseline. When flunarizine was compared to valproate no statistical significance was found in scores of CFFT, AAT, HST, RT, Frequency, duration, severity, global improvement and efficacy index. 
Conclusion: Flunarizine & Valproate were found to be equally efficacious to improve psychomotor performance.

It is broadly used in applications, like text clustering, text categorization, text classification, etc. Recently, the text clustering becomes the facilitating and challenging task used to group the text document. Due to some irrelevant terms and large dimension, the accuracy of text clustering is reduced. In this paper, the semantic word processing and novel Particle Grey Wolf Optimizer (PGWO) is proposed for automatic text clustering. Initially, the text documents are given as input to the pre-processing step which caters the useful keyword for feature extraction and clustering. Then, the resultant keyword is applied to wordnet ontology to find out the synonyms and hyponyms of every keyword. Subsequently, the frequency is determined for every keyword which is used to build the text feature library. Since the text feature library contains the larger dimension, the entropy is utilized to select the most significant feature. Finally, the new algorithm Particle Grey Wolf Optimizer (PGWO) is developed by integrating the particle swarm optimization (PSO) into the grey wolf optimizer (GWO). Thus, the proposed algorithm is used to assign the class labels to generate the different clusters of text documents. The simulation is performed to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, and the proposed algorithm is compared with existing algorithms. The proposed method attains the clustering accuracy of 80.36% for 20 Newsgroup dataset and the clustering accuracy of 79.63% for Reuter which ensures the better automatic text clustering.",0

Cerebral (Sco₂) and peripheral tissue (Sto₂) oxygen saturations can be measured using near infra-red spectroscopy. In a project simulating oxygen system failure during high altitude-high opening parachuting (HAHO), Sao₂, Spo₂, Sco₂, and forearm Sto₂ were measured. The aim of the present analysis was to explore the agreement between Sao₂ and the three noninvasive measurements of hypoxemia (Spo₂, Sco₂, and Sto₂).METHODS: Healthy volunteers from the Norwegian Special Operations Commando were studied in a hypobaric chamber as supplemental oxygen was removed at 301 hPa ambient pressure (30,000 ft) and recompressed at 25 hPa · min-1 (1000 ft · min-1) to ground level simulating a HAHO parachute flight. Sao₂ was compared with Spo₂, Sco₂, and Sto₂ in scatterplots and Bland-Altman plots, calculating bias and limits of agreement (LOA).RESULTS: The bias ± LOA were: Sao₂ vs. Spo₂: -5.8% ± 16, Sao₂ vs. Sco₂: -3.4% ± 11, and Sao₂ vs. Sto₂: 17% ± 30. The bias for Sao₂ vs. Spo₂ was dependent on the range of values, and correcting for this with a sloped bias line reduced the LOA to ± 8.2%.DISCUSSION: There were wide limits of agreement between Sao₂ and Spo₂. Sao₂ and Sco₂ agreed better, whereas Sao₂ and forearm Sto₂ had wide LOA. The agreement between Sao₂ and Spo₂ improved when correcting for the underestimation of Spo₂ at low values.

Following immunization with recombinant canarypox virus expressing gp160MN or with recombinant gp160MN/LAI, this antibody response was shown to be directed against the NH2-terminal region of the V3 loop. Although this response was increased by a prime-boost regimen using immunization with canarypox expressing gp160 followed by an rgp160 boost, its specificity remained restricted mainly to the recognition of this region of the V3 loop. Pepscan analysis of sera confirmed the results obtained by ELISA and allowed the definition of an immunodominant common binding site for these sera located within the sequence NKRKRIHIGPGR. In contrast to these results, a boost with the V3 peptide was shown to broaden the antibody response and pepscan analysis showed that sera from individuals boosted with the V3 synthetic peptide recognize determinants all along the V3 loop. Similar fine specificity of anti-V3 antibodies was obtained in human, guinea pig, and macaque following immunization by a prime-boost regimen using canarypox recombinants expressing gp160 or gp120 and purified rgp160. In contrast, a V3 synthetic peptide boost stimulated the production of antibodies that recognize multiple epitopes within the V3 loop.

The study of the frequency and evolution of upper digestive tract dyspepsia in a group of patients operated for early gastric cancer (EGC) and to perform a strategy of diagnosis for the patients with long term upper digestive tract dyspepsia.


METHODS
Clinical data of 35 patients operated for EGC were retrospectively evaluated. The frequency, characteristics and evolution time of upper digestive tract dyspepsia, main when it began more than 6 months before surgery, were analyzed. Radiologic and endoscopic exams carried out for diagnosis were also evaluated. Histological diagnosis of surgical specimens were considered, looking for the presence of chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and peptic gastric ulcer.


RESULTS
Long-term upper digestive tract dyspepsia was present in 27 patients (mean evolution time of 43.4 months). Clinical changes of previous symptoms that suggested gastric carcinoma were not found in 15 patients. Concurrent peptic gastric carcinoma were not found in 15 patients. Concurrent peptic gastric ulcer along with EGC was diagnosed by histology in 11 patients, and chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia were both present in the non-tumoral gastric mucosa in all cases.


CONCLUSIONS
1) Unspecific upper digestive tract dyspepsia is frequently found in patients with EGC. 2) Endoscopy should be the first exam performed in patients with upper digestive tract dyspepsia. 3) The patients with gastric ulcer, chronic atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia must be submitted to sequential endoscopic follow-up.",0

Criteria aiding optimization of the beam and factors that degrade the beam and produce alignment errors are discussed. Alignment accuracy depends upon correspondence of a reference beam to a mathematically ideal, perfectly symmetrical shape. It is shown that a beam closely approaching the ideal can be easily produced by this method.

Spontaneous portrayals were preferred by internals, and portrayals that involved mimetic-replication were favored by externals. Unsuccessful internals preferred the combined spontaneous/mimetic-replication alternative more than did the other internals. The relationship between personality and role playing, as well as the implications for clinical uses of behavior simulation conditions, is discussed.",0

Otherwise, any new concept or method, irrespective of its potential, may remain loose and not transferred into the form of truly working knowledge and useful applications. The common notion that DXA-derived BMD would represent a valid predictor of bone strength is based on high correlation (r values up to 0.9 or even more) between these two variables in controlled laboratory experiments. However, when large multicenter clinical trials on the effects of antiresorptive bisphosphonate therapy (alendronate and risendronate) or selective estrogen receptor modulator therapy (raloxifene) 1,2 reported consistently greater reductions in fracture incidence than could be anticipated from changes in BMD, speculations on possible additional effects of antiresorptive treatment on something yet unknown, called ""Bone Quality"", were inspired 2-7 . ""Bone Quality"" was defined as ""The sum total of characteristics of the bone that influence the bone’s resistance to fracture"", suggesting that BMD and ""Bone Quality"" together would independently account for bone fragility in totality (Figures 1A and 1B). The ""Bone Quality"" concept has since been embraced among the clinical osteoporosis community, as it seems to offer a panacea for the clinical paradox that while clinical BMD measurements can predict the relative fracture risk at the population level, the predictive value of BMD in individual patients remains quite marginal; one will fracture but another will not, despite similar BMD values 8-10 .

The diagnosis of a peripheral pulmonary nodule presents a challenge due to many diagnostic possibilities and pitfalls. We describe the cytologic features of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura, differential diagnoses, pertinent immunohistochemical stains and histogenesis.


CASES
Two cases of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura showed two cell populations on cytologic preparations; mesothelial cells and spindle cells. The neoplastic spindle cell component was positive for CD-34 and vimentin but not for cytokeratin.


CONCLUSION
Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura is rare but should be included in the differential diagnosis of a peripheral pulmonary nodule. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and rapid method of providing a confirmatory diagnosis.",0

Engulfment and cell motility 1 (Elmo1) serves as a mammalian homolog of Ced-12, which has been evolutionarily conserved from worm to human. The present study aimed to investigate the roles and mechanisms of Dock1 and Elmo1 in the migration and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) epithelial cells. Cell Counting kit-8, cell migration and cell invasion assays were performed to assess cell viability, migration and invasion, respectively. A plate clone formation assay was performed to determine cell proliferation. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays were used to evaluate mRNA and protein expression. The results revealed that the downregulation of Dock1 and Elmo1 inhibited cell viability, suppressed migration and invasion, and reduced Rac1 activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, downregulation of Dock1 and Elmo1 also attenuated the expression of migration-associated proteins and affected the Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA)/Rac1 pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that the downregulation of Dock1 and Elmo1 suppresses the migration and invasion of TNBC epithelial cells through the RhoA/Rac1 pathway.",0

In the recent years, botnets are becoming stealthier in nature by implanting certain techniques to hide themselves such as fast flux or DGA algorithms to generate the domain names. Generally, the class of botnet can be categorized into two major class-one which exploiting the IP protocol and another is using the DNS protocol for communications. The bot malwares who are using the DNS protocol are designed to remain unaffected over a long period of time. Once they receive the commands from the botmaster, they start to response to execute further actionable commands to perform SPAMs or DDoS attacks. To address such issues, BotMAD-Botnet Malicious Activity Detection based on DNS traffic pattern analysis is presented to detect such class of botnet family which are not detected by IP protocol based exploiting technique because IP may be changed by the botmaster by using fast flux or other techniques to make them stealth in nature. BotMAD — an automated DNS traffic Analyzer and Detector is introduced which automatically detect the malicious IP/Domain pair by inspecting the DNS packets from the network traces. Further the feed of DNSBL database is integrated with the system by fetching the records of malicious domains through Intel critical-stack API to enrich the database. To validate the accuracy of the system, two data sets are used-one is network traces of bot malwares captured on honeypots and second one domain reputation engines for validation. In the end, we conclude that the developed framework is giving the promising results in the form of botnet domain detection.",0

Regression models identified factors associated with treatment decisions. Mini-CTIM-tic scores correlated with tic severity and mini-CTIM-non-tic scores correlated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) severity. Tic treatment was associated with higher child, but not parent, mini-CTIM-tic scores.

These data have been used to test predictions of life history theory as well as to guide decisions of wildlife managers and conservation biologists. Life history theory predicts tradeoffs among life history traits, such that current reproductive effort will be negatively correlated with survival and/or future reproduction. Many studies support this prediction, but others report positive covariation between fitness traits, and attribute positive correlations to differences in individual quality. In this study, we used 11 yr of capture–mark–recapture data of breeding female Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa), along with their breeding histories, to examine sources of variation in annual survival rates and to assess the impact of current reproductive success on probabilities of survival and future reproductive success. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models indicated that apparent survival of female Wood Ducks did not vary annually and was only weakly affected by age class and breeding habitat conditions, but that there was a strong positive relationship between survival and the number of successful nests (0, 1, or 2). Next, we used a multistate analysis to examine the importance of female nest fate (successful or failed) on the probability of surviving and of nesting successfully the next year. Early incubation body mass was used to assess the nutritional status and quality of females. Females that nested successfully in year t were not less likely to nest successfully in year t + 1 than females that had nested unsuccessfully in year t. We also found strong positive covariation between nest success in year t and the probability of surviving. However, being in relatively good or poor condition had no effect on these relationships. Our results are consistent with the idea that female quality is heterogeneous, but body mass was not a good proxy of quality. Therefore, the existence of tradeoffs between female reproductive success and survival or future reproduction was less clear because of our inability to identify and control for differences in female quality.",0

Monoclonal antibodies and related conjugates are key reagents used in biomedical researches as well as, in treatment, purification and diagnosis of infectious and non- infectious diseases.


METHODS
Balb/c mice were immunized with purified human IgG. Spleen cells of the most immune mouse were fused with SP2/0 in the presence of Poly Ethylene Glycol (PEG). Supernatant of hybridoma cells was screened for detection of antibody by ELISA. Then, the sample was assessed for cross-reactivity with IgM & IgA by ELISA and confirmed by immunoblotting. The subclasses of the selected mAbs were determined. The best clone was injected intraperitoneally to some pristane-injected mice. Anti-IgG mAb was purified from the animals' ascitic fluid by Ion exchange chromatography and then, mAb was conjugated with HRP.


RESULTS
In the present study, over than 50 clones were obtained that 1 clone had optical density over than 3. We named this clone as supermonoclone which was selected for limiting dilution. The result of the immunoblotting, showed sharp band in IgG position and did not show any band in IgM&IgA position.


CONCLUSION
Based on the findings of this study, the conjugated monoclonal antibody could have application in diagnosis of infectious diseases like Toxoplasmosis, Rubella and IgG class of other infectious and non- infectious diseases.",0

Methods: A prospective registry of patients presenting to an academic colposcopy clinic was queried from 2008 to 2018. Women with missing race or cytology results, prior hysterectomy, or prior history of cervical, vulvar, or vaginal cancer were excluded. Poisson and logistic regression models were performed to evaluate the associations between race and colposcopy, LEEP, and cancer rates, adjusting for referral Papanicolaou (Pap), human papillomavirus (HPV) result, year of visit, age, insurance, pregnancy, number of sexual partners, and smoking status. Results: A total of 4506 women were included (56.1% white and 43.9% non-white). Referral for high-grade cytology was more likely among white compared to non-white women (22.5% vs. 17.5%, p < 0.001), as well as positive HPV testing (white 7.8% vs. non-white 6.0%, p < 0.001). The colposcopy rate was slightly higher among black (incidence rate ratio [IRR]adjusted 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.19, p = 0.006) and Hispanic women (IRRadjusted 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21, p = 0.0003) compared to white women. Hispanic women were significantly more likely to undergo LEEP (odds ratioadjusted 1.26, 95% CI 1.01-1.58, p = 0.04). However, no significant difference in cancer, adenocarcinoma in situ, or high-grade histology was noted by race. Conclusions: Black and Hispanic women referred for abnormal Pap or HPV results underwent a greater number of colposcopies compared to white women, and Hispanic women underwent a greater number of LEEPs. Although cancer is rare in our cohort, there was no statistical difference in rate of cancer by race.",0

The former allows pressure transmission when intra-abdominal pressure rises and may augment urethral sphincter pressures. The closer the locus of transmission is to the site of maximum urethral pressure, the greater should be the effect on continence. We aimed to test whether the location of urethral kinking is associated with SUI/USI. Methods: This was a retrospective study on patients who had undergone a urogynecological assessment including interview, urodynamic testing and 4D translabial ultrasound (TLUS). Urethral mobility was assessed using semi-automated Excel software. Mobility vectors were calculated using the formula √ [(xval_xrest)2+ (yval yrest)]. Location of urethral kinking was identified as a dorsally concave contour of the urethra on Valsalva in the midsagittal plane. The distance between the vertex of a kinking angle and the bladder neck is measured and represented as centile using the formula: Distance from bladder neck / urethral length. Results: Of 450 women seen, 143 were excluded due to previous incontinence surgery or missing data, leaving 307. 227(74%) complained of SUI, and 190 (62%) were diagnosed with USI. The location of urethral kinking was significantly associated with USI (63th vs 60th centile, P = 0.002). Conclusions: The further urethral kinking is from the midurethra, the more likely is USI. This provides circumstantial evidence for the pressure transmission theory of SUI.",0

Overall, this is a stimulating read that makes a valuable new contribution to our understanding of how and why America entered the war. But the author’s use of the “butterfly effect” to explain the ramifications of the Zimmermann telegram— whereby an apparently trivial incident in one part of the world can lead to huge, tornado-like upheavals somewhere else—does not quite do justice to the bureaucratizing effects of modern warfare, including the rise of the secret state. George Orwell’s observation in his 1939 novel Coming up for Air, that the Great War had caused the emergence of “huge Ministries with hordes of clerks and typists all drawing two pounds a week and upwards for piling up mounds of paper,” is closer to the mark here. From this perspective, the interception, decoding, and publication of the Zimmermann telegram seem like a far less random, chance series of events.

These systematic differences in experiences may contribute to different biological outcomes as individuals grow and develop, including at the neural level. Previous studies of biologically embedded experiences on neurodevelopment have focused on large-scale institutional or economic factors (e.g. socioeconomic status [SES]) and psychosocial factors (e.g. caregiving behavior). Less attention has focused on how the quality of the immediate home settings, such as the physical home environment (PHYS), influences neurodevelopment. Moreover, no study has investigated these effects in adolescents, who undergo significant physical maturation and neurodevelopment that may influence how they respond to their physical environments. The goal of the current study was to examine whether PHYS quality is biologically embedded in the developing adolescent brain as evidenced by cognitive achievement and cortical development in 56 (48% female) healthy adolescents (14-18 years (M = 16.83 years, SD = 1.17). Using in-home assessments of the physical home environment, anatomical brain scans, and indices of academic achievement, we found that adolescents who have more physical problems in the home (e.g. structural hazards, crowding, excessive noise, poorly lit) have thinner prefrontal cortices, which was associated with lower levels of reading achievement, independent of SES and psychosocial factors. By conducting home visits to assess physical characteristics of adolescents' home, we highlight a typically overlooked aspect of the home environment that has relevance for adolescents' cognitive and brain development.",0

In so doing, Wang engages in discussion with Alastair Iain Johnston, whose theory of cultural realism claims the existence of China-specific “realpolitik strategic culture” (p. 4). In contrast to Johnston, Wang sees material (power) premises, not cultural precepts, as the founding strategies of the Imperial state, and subsequently subsumes Johnston’s cultural realism under structural realism. Wang’s book provides an accessible, historically well-informed and methodologically well-constructed account of an important phenomenon of Chinese history. Its high quality will be apparent to general readers and researchers alike, with neither methodology nor substance overriding the other. What creates a sense of discontinuity, however, is Wang’s attempt to engage in discussion of China’s current strategic goals. As China’s global status grows, potential explanations of its behaviour are urgently sought. It seems hard to resist expanding one’s argument, originally aimed at a historical context, onto current discussions. Wang’s book is no exception. As a result, the last chapter on “Chinese power politics in the age of U.S. unipolarity” seems to lack the book’s previous clarity of argument. “Confucian pacifism” as an explanatory model has unexpectedly given way to “idealpolitik,” a new strategic model supposedly developed as a result of China’s socialisation to international institutions. Even more baffling is a complete exclusion of ideological factors from considerations of the PRC’s post-Cold War strategies. Such an omission can hardly be analytically justified, let alone defended historically. Moreover, in effective absence of Confucian socialisation since the early 20th century, and lack of “ideopolitik” in Wang’s equation, his analysis of contemporary China seems less convincing. Absence of a competing theoretical approach leaves Wang testing only structural hypotheses. This might leave readers who expect a similarly innovative approach to contemporary problems as to historical ones, inevitably disappointed. It also accounts for another problem: leaving a strong suggestion, but not an answer, to the question of China’s political strategy and potential offensiveness today. Despite this weakness, this book provides an absorbing attempt to shed new light on the role Confucian tradition played in power politics historically. In so doing, it uses a precise methodological and theoretical model for hypothesis testing, which adds much value to the book. The book as a whole provides readers with a powerful realisation of how much knowledge of China’s past and present is still missing.",0

However, they offered no new primary data to support their view, existing data were misinterpreted, the overwhelming body of evidence that SN status provides important staging information in addition to that provided by patient factors and primary tumour thickness was overlooked, and the recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Society of Surgical Oncology were ignored. The results of a large randomised controlled trial, the first Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-I), provided high-level evidence in support of the prognostic value of SNB and cemented its role as a high-yield, lowmorbidity staging procedure for patients at significant risk of occult lymph node metastasis. The 10-year melanomaspecific survival was substantially worse in SN-positive patients (HR 3.93, 95% CI 2.65–5.83, P < 0.001). Criticising the SNB staging procedure on the basis that some SLN-negative patients will eventually die of their disease is illogical. Breslow thickness is a similarly imperfect measure of risk and fails to take into account the site of the original primary or the age and sex of the patient, all of which have been repeatedly shown to be independent predictors of melanoma-specific survival. To accurately stage a patient, no one pathologic feature is examined in isolation. In the recent revision of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) melanoma staging system, multiple independent factors predictive of survival were identified by the AJCC Melanoma Expert Panel, based on analysis of the AJCC melanoma database (containing comprehensive information on >46 000 patients). One of the most important of these was SN status. Indeed, the prognostic significance of SN status was regarded as so important that SNB became an essential requirement for pathologic staging of patients with primary melanomas >1.0 mm thick (T2, T3 or T4) in the AJCC 8th Edition Melanoma Staging System; thus patients with melanomas >1.0 mm thick who do not undergo SNB cannot be pathologically staged utilising the current AJCC staging system. It makes no sense to say ‘There are statistical constructs that may give us general information for a population, but should never be used to give prognostic guidance to an individual patient’. It is our job as educated, experienced clinicians to critically appraise all available data, assess its reliability and generalisability, then provide advice to individual patients based on our conclusions. To debate whether SN status is the most important prognostic factor at the time of a patient’s initial presentation with a melanoma is unhelpful. It is but one of several prognostic factors, albeit the most important one in most large studies to date. What is clear is that SN-positive patients have a significantly worse prognosis and that this minimally invasive staging investigation provides information that is highly valuable for recommending treatment (particularly adjuvant systemic therapy), planning followup and stratifying patient groups for clinical trial purposes.

To examine the morbidity and mortality patterns of patients with asbestosis in New Zealand to determine (more fully) the overall health impact of past exposure to asbestos.


METHODS
Individual mortality, cancer and hospital records for all New Zealand men diagnosed with asbestosis between 1974-2001 were examined. Mortality data were analysed for time trends, cause of death, and occupation. Trends for patients diagnosed with asbestosis were compared with those diagnosed with lung cancer. Hospital discharge data for men with asbestosis were examined to determine reasons for hospitalisation, resource utility, and recent hospitalisation trends.


RESULTS
Death rates for New Zealand males dying with asbestosis increased between 1974-1999. Only 17% of deaths of males dying with asbestosis were directly attributed to this cause; the remainder were attributed to other non-malignant and malignant respiratory disease. Deaths from asbestos-related lung disease were grossly underestimated. Death certificates of men dying with asbestosis were found in all major occupational groups. Trends in hospital discharges may provide additional information for the overall modelling of the current epidemic of asbestos related disease.


CONCLUSION
The number of men dying with asbestosis in NZ has increased in line with mesothelioma. There is some indication that asbestosis prevalence may have peaked for the most serious cases of asbestosis. Some level of asbestos exposure, as indicated by asbestosis, may be present in all major occupational groups.",0

CINV typically manifests during two well-defined time periods (acute and delayed phases). The acute phase is the first 24 hours after chemotherapy and is largely managed with 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists. The delayed phase, a 5-day at-risk period during which patients are not often in direct contact with their health care provider, remains a significant unmet medical need. Neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists have demonstrated protection against acute and delayed CINV in patients treated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy when used in combination with a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone. Furthermore, recent data indicate that this protection is maintained over multiple treatment cycles. Rolapitant, a selective and long-acting NK-1 receptor antagonist, is approved as oral formulation for the prevention of delayed CINV in adults. This review discusses the differential pharmacology and clinical utility of rolapitant in preventing CINV compared with other NK-1 receptor antagonists.",0

This is true even though the optimal structured decentralized state-feedback controller with full model information is dynamic. In this paper, we show that, in contrast, the best limited model information control design strategy for the disturbance accommodation problem gives a dynamic controller. We find an explicit minimizer of the competitive ratio and we show that it is undominated, that is, there is no other control design strategy that performs better for all possible plants while having the same worst-case ratio. This optimal controller can be separated into a static feedback law and a dynamic disturbance observer. For constant disturbances, it is shown that this structure corresponds to proportional-integral control.",0

The virus also infected wild birds and continued to circulate and mutate in geese and ducks in southeastern China. Since this occurrence, new antigenic variants that are highly pathogenic for humans as well as wild, domestic, and exotic waterfowl continue to appear in Hong Kong. This virus is spreading across Asia, and is encroaching upon Europe and other continents. Wild birds are now considered as the main reservoir of H5N1 virus. Humans become infected with this H5N1 virus usually via close contact with infected birds or a highly contaminated environment. The very low transmissibility of this virus prevented further person‐to‐person dissemination in spite of the complete absence of immunity in the human population to H5N1 viruses. Viruses of the H5N1 subtype are characterized by an exceptionally high pathogenicity for humans. The cause of the viral virulence is not known so far; however, several virulence factors are considered. The unprecedented capability of H5N1 viruses to kill humans intensifies the concern about its pandemic potential with catastrophic consequences. The effectiveness of existing antivirals as well as vaccines for humans and birds are reviewed.",0

Developmental rate, total cell number in hatching blastocyst stage, number of apoptotic cells, diameter of embryos, transgene integration and transgenic mosaicism were investigated. The rate of rabbit embryos microinjected with the different gene constructs developed up to morula stage was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of intact (non-microinjected) rabbit embryos (66–74vs. 98%). The highest efficiency of transgene integration (15%) was found when the CMVIE–EGFP (DrdI) gene construct was used, however a significantly higher transgenic mosaicism (60%) was found in rabbit embryos using this gene. The lowest cell number was counted in rabbit transgenic embryos with CMVIE–rhGFP linearized by ScaI (115.0 ± 8.20), the highest cell number (134.0 ± 35.00) was detected in rabbit transgenic embryos carrying PGK–EGFP (Not I) gene. The highest number of apoptotic cells (2.6 ± 0.33) was recorded in rabbit transgenic embryos with the integrated CMVIE–EGFP (ClaI) transgene. Based on these results a more suitable gene marker for rabbit transgenic embryos production and selection is the CMVIE–EGFP (ClaI) gene construct. Prior to using microinjected embryos (for embryo transfer, vitrification or ESC isolation) it is necessary to pre-select microinjected embryos with evident transgenic mosaicism.",0

For improving its exploration ability as well as reducing the probability of its falling into a local optimum, this work proposes to add a novel competition mechanism with historical information feedback to current DA. Specifically, the fitness value of each dandelion in the next generation, which is calculated by linear prediction, is compared with the current best dandelion, and the loser is replaced by a new offspring. Current DA generates new offsprings without considering historical information. This work improves its offspring generation process by exploiting historical information with an estimation-of-distribution algorithm. Three historical information models are designed. They are best, worst, and hybrid historical information feedback models. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform DA and its variants, and the proposed algorithms are superior or competitive to nine participating algorithms benchmarked on 28 functions from CEC2013. Finally, the proposed algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness on four real-world problems, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithms have better performance than its peers.",0

With the increase in the installed capacity of the renewable energy resources, the determination of the power grid connection points has gained importance. Failure to correctly identify the feasible grid connection points extends the timeline of return of investment of the power plants. Within the scope of this study, a new methodology has been developed to determine the number of regional wind power plants that can be connected to a grid connection point depending on economic and technical criteria as well as the installed capacity of these power plants. In the developed methodology; the geographical structure of the region, technical characteristics of turbine technologies used in wind power plants, electrical grid criteria and economic connection criteria of wind power plants are taken into consideration. WindPRO, a wind power analysis program, was used in the definition of regional variables. The dataset obtained from the WindPRO program was used in the analysis of installation of wind turbines with different tower heights and different installed powers (50 MW, 100 MW, etc.). Investment costs of turbine technologies and energy transmission system integration costs were taken into consideration in determining bus-based installation costs. As a result, the possible costs of the wind power plants that can be established for bus connection points in a zone defined on the energy transmission system were determined. Thus, the preliminary working time of the energy planners will be shortened and the most economic regions related to the wind power plant technology will be chosen.",0

The lack of a standardized methodology and understanding of how antinutritional factors influence indigestible residues can result in erroneous estimates with inconsistent variation across trials and among studies. Previous studies have detailed suitable bag porosity and sample size (SS) with incubation length (IL) varying from 96 to 504 h, with many assuming that 288-h IL yields truly indigestible components. Recent studies have primarily investigated the variation that exists among feedstuffs, but most have failed to account for possible effects of secondary compounds. Using two similar concentrate diets, one of which contained supplemental condensed tannins (CT), we investigated the effect of bag type (BT; 10 and 25 μm), SS (20 and 40 mg/cm2), and IL (288 and 576 h) on in situ indigestible dry matter (iDM) and neutral detergent fiber (iNDF) residues of feed and feces, and resultant DM and NDF digestibilities. There were no three-way interactions (P > 0.05), but two-way interactions were present for iDM and iNDF residues with BT × SS influencing the control (no CT) ration (P < 0.01), SS × IL impacting feed containing CT (P < 0.01), and BT × IL affecting both feedstuffs (P ≤ 0.01). For the control diet, only BT × SS affected DM and NDF digestibilities. Whereas, the CT diet did not demonstrate any significant interactions for digestibilities. Values of iDM were largely influenced by contamination that varied greatly based on intrinsic factors associated with the bag and incubation duration. The presence of CT influenced iDM and iNDF to varying degrees due to possible trapping of CT-substrate complexes. For the control diet, the use of 25-μm bags resulted in lower fecal recoveries relative to the 10-μm (P < 0.01). However, there appears to be a dynamic relationship among BT, SS, and IL within respective diets and sample types that can impact indigestible components and resultant digestibility estimates. Based upon simulations from these data, the sample size required to attain 90% power when utilizing two incubation animals exceeds the triplicate and quadruplicate replications commonly utilized. Further emphasizing the necessity for a more complete understanding of incubation dynamics in order to design biologically and statistically valid investigations.",0

Four months later, he was admitted to our hospital for removal of the FCSEMS. However, abdominal X-ray and duodenoscopy revealed that the stent had fractured in the mid-portion and the inferior end was located above the distal bile duct stricture (▶Fig.1b). Because of the benign stricture, it was necessary to retrieve the stent remnants. We attempted to achieve this by several methods, using grasping forceps or balloon catheters, but encountered great difficulty when the fractured stent became stuck in the stricture. After several attempts, we were able to grasp the bottom edge of the fractured stent using biopsy forceps (Radial Jaw 4P; Boston Scientific, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) and remove it through the distal bile duct stricture without any complications by gentle pushing of the endoscope (in the same way as a lithotripsy: twisting the endoscope clockwise while advancing it to the anal side of the duodenum) (▶Fig. 2). Finally, we succeeded in extracting the stent using a snare through the scope. FCSEMS are primarily used to treat malignant strictures, but recently they have been coming into use to treat benign strictures [1]. Stent fracture is a rare complication of FCSEMS, and there are few reports about FCSEMS fracturing above benign distal bile duct strictures [2, 3]. In the present case, residual stenosis made it very difficult to grasp the FCSEMS and remove it through the stenosis. No standard methods have yet been established for removal of fractured FCSEMS. Therefore, a variety of devices should be used as appropriate for each individual case. E-Videos",0

The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between autistic-like traits (ALTs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NFKB1 (encoding a subunit of the NF-κB protein complex) and NF-κB inhibitor-like protein 1 (NFKBIL1). Methods: The study was conducted in a cohort from the general population: The Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS, n = 12 319, 9–12 years old). The subjects were assessed by the Autism-Tics, ADHD, and Other Comorbidities Inventory. Five SNPs within the two genes were genotyped (NFKBIL1: rs2857605, rs2239707, rs2230365 and rs2071592; NFKB1: rs4648022). Results: We found significant associations for two SNPs in NFKBIL1: rs2239707 showed a significant distribution of genotype frequencies in the case-control analysis both for all individuals combined and in boys only, and rs2230365 was significantly associated with the ALTs-module language impairment in boys only. Furthermore, we found nominal association in the case-control study for rs2230365, replicating earlier association between this SNP and ASD in an independent genome-wide association study. Conclusion: The shown associations between polymorphisms in NFKBIL1 and ALTs are supporting an influence of the immune system on neuropsychiatric symptoms.",0

One of the most important risks faced by the private sector is demand risk. For years researchers have focused on how this kind of risk should be distributed between the government and the private sector. Some researchers argue that parties subject to losses should undertake the risk, which will help stimulate them to do better risk control. However, the demand risk is exogenous and thus cannot be prevented or controlled by either party. Considering the cooperation feature of PPP between the government and the private sector, the demand risk should be shared by both parties. Researchers put forward that signing ex ante guarantee arrangement with the government can be regarded as a method to reduce the risk losses of the private sector. However, the demand guaranteed by the government is specified at the time of contract signing before the occurrence of risk, problems of overcompensation or undercompensation may emerge due to bounded rationality. Therefore, currently researches have shifted their attention to how the compensation amount should be determined by the government when the demand risk occurs.At present, there are two research gaps with regard to this issue. First, scholars failed to take into consideration the calculation method of compensation amount in their studies, leading to ambiguity and even possible occurrence of corruption as perceived by the public when the government honours compensation. To solve this problem, the demand compensation mechanism should be proposed and detailed, thus making the compensation process a transparent one. Second, previous studies only focused on efficiency improvement, leaving fairness of distribution neglected, which is harmful to the sustainable development of PPP projects. Therefore, both of private sector's benefits and consumer surplus should be paid attention to when the government compensates the private sector so that a win-win situation can be achieved. To fill these gaps, our study focuses on conditions of Pareto-improvement for both private sector's benefits and consumer surplus under demand compensation mechanism in PPP transportation infrastructures whose revenue depends on charges collected from users. We first analyze how the demand compensation mechanism affects the private sector's profit and consumer surplus when the ceiling price is fixed. Results indicate that in this situation the mechanism improves private sector's benefits by an increasing price while damaging consumer surplus. Therefore, to realize both parties' Pareto-improvement, the government should first reset the ceiling price.This study then explores the impact of demand compensation mechanism when the ceiling price is reset. Results show that effective zone of compensation amount exists to realize Pareto-improvement when both parties' renegotiation costs are low. In addition, numerical examples are applied to test and verify these results. In summary, the demand compensation mechanism can realize Pareto-improvement when the ceiling price is allowed to be reset and the renegotiation costs for both parties are low. Our study results are of significance for the government to make correct decisions on compensation amount, and provide theoretical guidance for risk sharing between public and private sectors such that sustainable development of PPP projects can be promoted.",0

A characteristic feature of the Russian cultural landscape is the extremely radical character of either side and sharp confrontations between them, which at times (particularly, in the Soviet era) become a substitute for otherwise impossible ideological and political polemics. In this light, the article examines such events in the history of the Russian humanities as the nineteenth-century utilitarian aesthetics; the Romantic idea of the “national spirit” embodied in forms of the national language; the Formal literary theory and structural linguistics as voices of opposition to the state ideology and cultural policy; and semiotics of culture as an integral part of revolution in cultural studies in the 1960s and 1970s.",0

As the traditional routing protocols, which assume continuous connection between nodes and need to be aware of network topology, cannot be implemented in OppNets, various OppNet routing protocols, such as Epidemic, PRoPHET etc., have been proposed for message delivery. An OppNet’s message delivery mechanism is store-and-forward in which a node stores incoming messages and forwards the copies of the messages to nodes it encounters causing a large overhead in the network. Furthermore, as nodes are mobile and are powered by batteries, it is essential to consume less energy and extend the network life so that a large number of messages can be delivered. In order to improve the message deliverability of a node, network overhead and network life expectancy in existing OppNet protocols, we consider the node’s resources, whose values change continuously, while transferring messages in the networks. In our proposal, a node first calculates its Message Deliverability (MD) which depends upon the protocol used and its resources. The node then uses its MD and the encountered node’s MD to make message forwarding decision. Extensive simulation results have shown that the message delivery probability, network overhead and network life of existing OppNet protocols can be improved significantly using our proposal. ",0

Purpose
Stunting and being underweight in children are major nutritional problems especially in developing countries. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of egg supplementation on a vitamin and mineral fortification program for growth, cognitive development and hemoglobin in underweight and stunted children.


Design/methodology/approach
This was an experimental study using a crossover design conducted in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. A total of 39 subjects were randomly selected from two community health centers and provided with two types of intervention: vitamin and mineral fortification sprinkle (Taburia) and Taburia with egg supplementation (Taburia PLUS). Each intervention was conducted for three months with one-month of washout period in between interventions.


Findings
There were no changes in weight-for-age Z-score in Taburia and Taburia PLUS (all p > 0.05). The height-for-age Z-score was increased in Taburia PLUS (p = 0.022) but not in Taburia (p > 0.05). Hemoglobin level was significantly increased in Taburia (p = 0.039) but not in Taburia PLUS (p > 0.05). There were no significant changes in visual motoric score in Taburia, but there were slight increases in Taburia PLUS (all p > 0.05).


Originality/value
The authors concluded that egg supplementation combined with multivitamins and minerals fortification program, Taburia PLUS, is beneficial to improve linear growth but not hemoglobin in stunted and underweight children.

This problem has hindered the use of this powerful technique for lossy image compression. An exhaustive codebook search requires that an input vector be compared against each code vector in the codebook in order to find the code vector that yields the minimum distortion. Because an exhaustive search does not capitalize on any underlying structure of the code vectors in hyperspace, other researchers have proposed technique that exploit codebook structure, but these technique typically result in sub-optimal distortion. We propose a new method that exploits the nearest neighbor structure of code vectors and significantly reduces the number of computations required in the search process. However, this technique does not introduce additional distortion, and is thus optimal. Our method requires a one time precomputation and a small increase in the memory required to store the codebook. In the best case, arising when the code vectors are largely dispersed in the hyperspace, our method requires only partial search of the codewords. In the worst case, our method requires a full search of the codebook. Since the method depends on the structure of the code vectors in the hyperspace, it is difficult to determine its efficiency in all cases, but test on typical image compression tasks have shown that this method offers on average an 81.16 percent reduction in the total number of multiples, additions and subtractions required as compared to full search.",0

The exact Bayesian inference is, however, possible in only a narrow class of probabilistic models enjoying the conjugacy principle. It is rather typical that the principle does not hold, and therefore the approximate Bayesian inference methods are taken into account. The present paper compares some of these techniques on a mixture filtering problem. The methods are presented in a generic way, considering that the mixture components are members of the exponential family of probability distributions and that the Markov model of switching between the mixture components is known. A particular instance of the methods is given for a mixture of normal linear state space models, and experiments evaluating the estimation precision and computational time are performed.",0

In control subjects, insulin-induced hypoglycemia resulted in marked increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. Heart rates were increased within 15 minutes after the insulin injection which were associated with slight elevation and depression of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. In patients with upper level spinal cord lesions (C1-T6) of various etiology, Shy-Drager syndrome and familial amyloidosis, insulin-induced hypoglycemia failed to increase plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels and resulted in falls in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure 15 minutes after the injection. Heart rates were increased at 30-45 minutes after the injection. In patients with lower spinal cord lesions (T10-L1), neurosyphilis or brain stem tumor with orthostatic hypotension, the catecholamine responses were normal and blood pressure did not fall during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In patients with Parkinson's disease and spinocerebellar degeneration with autonomic symptoms catecholamine responses were not impaired. These findings suggest that any lesion involving the sympathetic efferent systems of baroreflex such as the spinal descending pathway, sympathetic preganglionic neuron and peripheral nervous system causes both impairment of catecholamine secretion and a fall in blood pressure during hypoglycemia, and that lesions in sympatho-afferent system may not affect the secretion of catecholamine and neural control of blood pressure.",0

Therefore, this paper proposes that the ordinary RAM with backup power supply or nonvolatile random access memory could be used directly as the software black box (SBB), rather than as an intermediary to external memory. This SBB can record the operation information closest to failure time before software failure in real time. It efficiently solves the problem of being unable to restore the fault site on software fault diagnosis, and provides a new method for improving software reliability.",0

In our approach, we tune the actor-critic algorithm to only leverage on QoS parameters in order to load balance traffic in the network and maximize the QoE experienced by the users. This avoids having to collect observations and performance measurements from client applications, as it only focuses on network metrics that can be easily measured.

The level of PTEN was significantly up-regulated in omparison with control groups,no variation was found in total AKT, but the expression of p-AKT was down-regulated.


CONCLUSION
The overexpression of miR-30a is abled to down-regulate the level of BCR/ABL mRNA and BCR/ABL protein, and increase apoptotic rate, its mechanism may be related with inhibition of the activity of BCR/ABL-PTEN/AKT signaling pathway.",0

We show how it is possible to retrieve suitable information about molecular mechanisms governing the cell response to conditional perturbations. This task is complex because typical high-throughput genomics experiments are performed with high number of probesets (103–104 genes) and a limited number of observations (< 102 time points). In this paper, we develop a deepest analysis of our previous work [Remondini et al., 2005] in which we characterized some of the main features of a gene-gene interaction network reconstructed from temporal correlation of gene expression time series. One first advancement is based on the comparison of the reconstructed network with networks obtained from randomly generated data, in order to characterize which features retrieve real biological information, and which are instead due to the characteristics of the network reconstruction method. The second and perhaps more relevant advancement is the characterization of the global change in co-expression pattern following cMyc activation as compared to a basal unperturbed state. We propose an analogy with a physical system in a critical state close to a phase transition (e.g. Potts ferromagnet), since the cell responds to the stimulus with high susceptibility, such that a single gene activation propagates to almost the entire genome. Our result is relative to temporal properties of gene network dynamics, and there are experimental evidence that this can be related to spatial properties regarding the global organization of chromatine structure [Knoepfler et al., 2006].",0

We have experimented with the Lockheed Expert System (LES) to see if contextual information can be useful in interpreting aerial photographs. First, the grey-scale image is segmented into uniform or slowly-varying intensity regions or contiguous textured regions using an edge-based segmentation technique. Next, the system computes a set of attributes for each region. Some of these attributes are based on local properties of that region only (e.g., area, average-intensity, texture-strength, etc.), while others are based on contextual or global information (e.g., adjacent-regions and nearby-regions). Finally, LES is given the task of classifying all the regions using the attribute values. It makes use of multiple goals and multiple rule sets to determine the best classification; regions, which do not satisfy any of the rules, are left unclassified. Unlike programs which use statistical methods, LES uses contextual information such as the fact that cars are likely to be adjacent to roads, which significantly improves its performance on regions which are difficult to classify.",0

The weekly schedule of paclitaxel is a common regimen around the world. Oral 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) is an intermediate metabolite of Capecitabine. Thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase) is an essential enzyme for the activation of the cytostatics 5'-DFUR / Capecitabine to 5-fluorouracil in tumors. Paclitaxel reportedly increased dThdPase levels in tumors in vivo study. To assess the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel in combination with 5'-DFUR in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer.


METHODS
Eligible patients had measurable and/or evaluable metastatic lesions and were aged 20-75 years with a WHO performance status of 0-1. Those who had taken paclitaxel before and had peripheral neuropathy were excluded. Dose escalation schema was shown below. The main toxicities (NCI-CTC version 2) in the dose-escalation step were as follows: Grade (G) 4 neutropenia (for 4 days), febrile neutropenia, G 4 thrombocytopenia and G 3 nonhematological toxicity without nausea and vomiting were considered to be dose limiting.


RESULTS
Fifteen patients with a median age of 56 years (range 43-69) were included. Anti-tumor activity was assessed in total 15 patients, as 2 CR, 5 PR, 2 NC, 4 PD and 2 NE (response rate; 46.7%). At Level 1, one of six patients had DLT (febrile neutropenia). However, six patients did not reach DLT at Level 2 and 3. Then two patients had DLT at Level4, so it was regarded as MTD.


CONCLUSIONS
Weekly paclitaxel in combination with 5'-DFUR did not increase hematological and nonhematological toxicity. Level 4 (paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 and 5'-DFUR 1,200 mg/body) was MTD. We decided that the recommended dose is Level 3 (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 and 5'-DFUR 1200 mg/body). No significant financial relationships to disclose.",0

Most existing binary optimization methods either use continuous relaxation which can cause large quantization errors, or incorporate a highly specific algorithm that can only be used for particular loss functions. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel generalized optimization method, named Alternating Binary Matrix Optimization (ABMO), for solving BOPs. ABMO can handle BOPs with/without orthogonality or linear constraints for a large class of loss functions. ABMO involves rewriting the binary, orthogonality and linear constraints for BOPs as an intersection of two closed sets, then iteratively dividing the original problems into several small optimization problems that can be solved as closed forms. To provide a strict theoretical convergence analysis, we add a sufficiently small perturbation and translate the original problem to an approximated problem whose feasible set is continuous. We not only provide rigorous mathematical proof for the convergence to a stationary and feasible point, but also derive the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm. The promising results obtained from four binary optimization tasks validate the superiority and the generality of ABMO compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",0

To collect and triangulate my data, I asked the preservice teachers to respond to weekly electronic surveys, engaged in focus groups with them, kept reflection notes, and presented his dilemmas and findings to colleagues. Using a narrative analytical process, I uncovered assumptions that affected my relationship and results with the teachers and questioned identities held by himself and the preservice teachers as possibly being unhealthy. The need to consider how the instruction of critical thinking is presented to preservice teachers as well as studying ways to support positive, empowering identify formation in emerging teachers is discussed.",0

The FWHM is nearly four times larger than that of a single band absorber. In addition, the absorptivity of each peak can be independently tuned by phase modulation. Since only magnetic resonances in the form of catenary optical fields in the upper and lower dielectric layers can be excited for symmetrical inputs, the number of absorption peaks will be reduced by half at this time. The absorption frequency under symmetrical inputs can be flexibly selected from low frequency to high frequency by changing the material of the upper and lower dielectric layers. Moreover, the bandwidth in optimized broadband absorber is enhanced by 9 times while high absorbance is maintained. The characteristic of the enhancing absorption bandwidth and the selective absorption may allow our metasurface to be used in many applications such as optical switch and modulators.",0

An intense protocol with frequent antibiotic administration was chosen. Samples from aqueous humor were obtained 2 and 6 h after the start of the treatment. Samples from cornea and iris were obtained at the end of the experiment, after euthanasia of the animals. Drug concentrations were measured by HPLC method. The median levels of ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin in aqueous humor of healthy animals, 2 and 6 h after drug administration were 6.39–9.65 and 5.30–6.81 µg/ml, respectively. Ciprofloxacin levels were neither changed from the inflammation nor after instillation of diclofenac. In contrary, lomefloxacin concentrations in aqueous humour of inflamed eye were significantly increased 12.15–15.08 µg/ml, especially after diclofenac administration (17.12–27.76 µg/ml). Levels of both fluoroquinolones in cornea (13.08 µg/g for ciprofloxacin and 12.25 µg/g for lomefloxacin) and in iris (0.84 µg/g for ciprofloxacin and 1.34 µg/g for lomefloxacin) were higher than MIC and MBC values against S. aureus ATCC 25923.

Then in the 1960s, urine tests to measure blood glucose levels became available for home use; in 1976, the first home pregnancy test kit was issued. Today, patients can, among other things, measure their cholesterol, determine a child's paternity, or detect HIV infection. Steven Gutman, MD, director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) division of clinical laboratory devices, said that an even broader range of home tests is on the horizon. Technology is moving like lightning, and a wide range of analytes will give us a dazzling array of products, Gutman promised. In the last 6 months alone, we've cleared an over-the-counter product to test for fructosamine, designed to be used as an adjunctive test for diabetes, and two manufacturers' home tests for monitoring prothrombin. The benefit of some home medical tests is not just the test but reporting of the data in a useful format. Plotting the results of tests done regularly at home, such as blood pressure, blood glucose, or peak airflow velocity, makes the patient's story jump off of the page, said Stephen K. Plume, MD, president of the Hitchcock Clinic in Lebanon, New Hampshire. We are finding that the patient and physician are becoming much more knowledgeable partners about the disease process. And there are as many stories and learning opportunities as there are patients. Marilyn Duffy, clinical quality coordinator at Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Hampshire in Manchester, described the use of peak airflow meters by the health plan's asthmatic patients. One 56-year-old patient had become accustomed to a peak flow of 200 L/min and determined that it was the best she could expect. (The normal range for a woman her age and height is 386 L/min to 418 L/min.) During a triggering episode at Christmas, her airflow reading dropped to 70 L/min and the home monitor indicated that she needed urgent care. She went to the emergency department, received prompt treatment, and returned home feeling better. Since that episode, with twice-daily monitoring that pinpoints environmental triggers, she has worked with her primary care physician to raise her baseline peak flow to 600 L/min. After years of having patients with diabetes record their blood glucose levels in notebooks that yielded little helpful information, Larry V. Staker, MD, director of clinical practice improvement at Intermountain Health Care in Salt Lake City, developed a specification chart containing a treatment-to-goal line at a glucose level of 110 mg/dL. The chart also contains two other dotted lines, below and above which the patient's measurements should not go. His patients with type 2 diabetes plot their daily fasting plasma glucose level and connect the dots. It's magic, described Staker. Patients immediately see where you want them to be, and they immediately see where they are. It causes them to consider the effects of their activities and become accountable. This is the first time in 20 years that patients have come to me asking for dietary interventions and changes in medications. Safety Measures One of the major concerns physicians express about home tests is whether the patient can perform the test properly without medical supervision and use the results safely and effectively. The FDA will approve a test for home use only if it can be easily used by a consumer, Gutman explained. Instructions are written at a 7th-grade reading level and are accompanied by large, clear illustrations. When the FDA determines that a physician is needed to correctly interpret the results of a home test, as was the case with the two prothrombin tests approved in 1997, the tests are made available by prescription only. This gives the physicians an opportunity to provide appropriate training. Joseph DeVito, MD, clinical instructor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine in New York City, stated that the type of test is a key determinant of how much education the physician needs to provide. I think everyone can figure out how to use a home pregnancy test kit. But, he said, there are certain tests, for example the HIV test or the blood pressure cuff, for which the medical provider needs to take some time with the patient. He offered the following example: When patients are going to be using the blood pressure cuff for the first time, I ask them to bring it in. I test it on myself, to make sure it's giving an accurate reading, then I work with them until I'm satisfied they know how to use it. Sometimes No Substitute DeVito added that in some cases the psychological help the physician provides is just as important as clinical expertise. I'm not sure about HIV home tests. I don't think anything can substitute for pre-and post-test counseling by a professional. Consumers may agree. Home HIV tests have been available for more than a year (Ann Intern Med. 1996; 125:I-62-3), but the Confide test by Johnson & Johnson, which received strong marketing support, has been withdrawn from the market because of lack of consumer interest, according to a spokesman. At least three other HIV tests are currently available. Plume remains optimistic about certain home tests, with a caveat. We are witnessing the benefits of technologies that are reliable enough so that we don't need to house them in medical facilities, and we're learning, albeit slowly, about the impact of the way the information is presented, he explained. But it does mean that providers have to let go of some of what they do now. With home testing, we're pushing information gathering, reporting, and interpretation into the hands of the people with the problems. Moving these duties out of the sole province of the clinician creates psychological difficulties for both patient and physician that require adequate communication between the two parties, Plume stressed.

Two hundred ninety samples were collected from feces (n=136), carcasses [n=140 (cattle: n=61, swine: n=79)], and washing water (n=14) in nine slaughterhouses. Eleven human isolates were obtained from hospitals and the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Listeria monocytogenes was enriched and identified, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16S rRNA sequencing. Serovars and presence of virulence genes were determined, and genetic correlations among the isolates were evaluated by the restriction digest patterns of AscI. Antibiotic resistance of L. monocytogenes isolates were examined against 12 different antibiotics. Of 290 slaughterhouse samples, 15 (5.17%) carcass samples were L. monocytogenes positive. Most L. monocytogenes isolates possessed all the virulence genes, while polymorphisms in the actA gene were found between carcass and human isolates. Serovars 1/2a (33.3%) and 1/2b (46.7%) were the most frequent in carcass isolates. Genetic correlations among the isolates from carcass and clinical isolates were grouped within serotypes, but there were low geographical correlations. Most L. monocytogenes isolates were antibiotic resistant, and some strains showed resistance to more than four antibiotics. These results indicate that L. monocytogenes are isolated from carcass and human in Korea, and they showed high risk serotypes and antibiotic resistance. Therefore, intensive attentions are necessary to be aware for the risk of L. monocytogenes in Korea.",0

The pathogenesis of the disease is complex and not fully understood, nevertheless, genetic and environmental factors play an important role. So far, about 30 genes have been identified to be involved in the SLE pathomechanism. However, not all genetically predisposed individuals develop the disease. This phenomenon can be associated with epigenetic changes that occur under the influence of environmental factors. They can affect gene expression and are potentially hereditary, but do not lead to changes in the nucleotide sequence. Epigenetic dysfunctions, identified in the course of the disease, lead to changes in the expression of genes that play a key role in maintaining the body's immune tolerance. Major mechanisms of epigenetic variability are: DNA methylation, histone protein modification, non-coding RNA expression, as well as gene imprinting. The major epigenetic dysfunctions affecting the pathogenesis of the disease are global hypomethylation on CD4+ T cells resulting from ERK signaling pathway regulation, histone hypoacetylation, histone H3 lysine methylation, and reactivation of inactive chromosome X. In lupus patients, various epigenetic mechanisms interact with each other, enhancing the expression or silencing of genes responsible for the production of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and activation of autoreactive B-lymphocytes.",0

Data sources include teacher interviews, design meetings between researchers and teachers, and classroom observations. We find that teachers with different pedagogical visions adopted the tools for reinforcement, student engagement, and formative assessment. We document teachers' iterative improvement strategies and shifts in teacher noticing, particularly the objects (i.e., computer science vocabulary and concepts), level (i.e., whole-class versus individual students), and depth of how they noticed students learning through video reflections.

The uniformity of treatment during the first 30 years has been substituted by a variety of new methods, allowing a specific attribution to different underlying diseases. Whereas haemodialysis, haemofiltration and intermittent peritoneal dialysis exhibit a relatively broad spectrum of indications, CAPD, haemoperfusion and plasmapheresis are restricted to a reduced number of underlying diseases. Certain diseases, until a few years ago regarded as a contra-indication for blood purification treatment, are today considered to be specific indications for newly developed methods of treatment, for example diabetic nephropathy for CAPD and vascular instability for haemofiltration or its modifications. Apart from this individualization an important trend of modern artificial kidney design has been the attempt to miniaturize the devices in order to facilitate their application and to encourage self-treatment. This trend could result in a concentration of the patients on self-care and a substantial reduction of treatment costs. Moreover, a miniaturized artificial organ could reduce many immunological problems, which today result from transplantation of natural kidney. Imitation of the natural kidney has been an important goal of many investigators during the last years. Promising approaches have been attempted by the development of haemofiltration, imitating the process of glomerular filtration, or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, copying the continuously excreting natural kidney. In his assay 'De Urina', Homer Smith says, 'This liquid, which commonly inspires men only with contempt and disgust, which is generally ranked amongst vile and repulsive matters has become, in the hands of the chemists, a source of important discoveries'. Today the inspiration of the chemists has been replaced by the unceasing endeavours of technicians to create an artificial organ which produces a urine of similar qualities.",0

Financial con ̄icts of interest have been the subject of many editorials, and most peer-reviewed journals now require any con ̄icts to be identi®ed and explained when authors submit manuscripts for publication. Clear statements of industry sponsored research and author participation in corporate activities are required for evaluation of a manuscript. Full disclosure of ®nancial interests by authors is essential to retain public trust in biomedical research, the peer-review process and the integrity of the authors and of the universities (DeAngelis et al., 2001). We already require that each author sign a statement of his or her ®nancial arrangements with public, private and industry sources of support. These declarations alert the editor, reviewer and physician-reader to any potential bias in the interpretation and presentation of the data. Patients' lives may depend on an accurate and complete understanding of how and why authors obtained facts relating to therapies. Non-®nancial con ̄icts of interest between authors and corporate sponsors are of equal concern and require our attention. These include the need for an open and candid relationship between authors and the policies of the sponsoring companies with regard to academic freedom. Issues of control and complete access to all data, conduct of statistical studies and analyses, manuscript preparation and decisions to publish are of increasing importance and concern. Corporate sponsors must not be allowed to in ̄uence publication, or indeed to prevent it, especially when the data are not supportive of their product. Authors, editors and industry sponsors are aware of these matters and it is now time to address them (DeAngelis et al., 2001). These issues have been addressed in recent editorials in JAMA and The New England Journal of Medicine. The editors of JAMA, The New England Journal of Medicine, Canadian Medical Association Journal, Journal of the Danish Medical Association, The Lancet, MEDLINE/Index Medicus, New Zealand Medical Journal, Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association, Dutch Journal of Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, Medical Journal of Australia and the Western Journal of Medicine have all agreed to require authors to disclose details of their own and the sponsor's role in the study (Davido et al., 2001). Authors will be required to sign a statement indicating that they accept full responsibility for the conduct of the study, had access to all the data and had the authority to publish it. An amendment was made allowing the sponsor up to 60 days to review a manuscript before publication to allow for the ®ling of additional patent protection, if necessary. These policies will also be incorporated into the next revision of `Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals' (Davidson et al., 1997). We believe that neurology journals should invoke the same philosophy and implement the same procedures. We ®rmly believe that manuscripts submitted to our journals are the intellectual property of the authors, not the study sponsor. Academic freedom includes the right of authors to have access to all of the data obtained in their study, to review it, obtain statistical analyses independently and to publish their data based on their own decisions and not those of the ®nancial sponsor (Davidson et al., 1997; Davido et al., 2001; DeAngelis et al., 2001). We will now require the principal author to declare in writing that he or she will take full responsibility for the data, the analyses and interpretation, and the conduct of the research; that he or she had full access to all of the data; and that he or she had the right to publish any and all data, separate and apart from the attitudes of the sponsor. Without these written assurances, we will not consider the paper for review. We believe this new policy will ensure not only greater academic freedom, but also increased credibility for data in our journals that have been the product of academic and corporate alliances.",0

The government, particularly at the local level, plays a vital role in reducing such risk. Therefore, strengthening the capacity of local governments is needed to reach the goal. This necessity is clearly stated in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDDR) 2015-2030. The capacity of local government in disaster risk management is essential in preventing and minimizing the number of victims. Floods and forest and land fire haze are the most common disasters in Jambi Province. Understanding the local government capacity is imperative in the context of disaster risk reduction as such. This paper aims to explain the current capacity of the Jambi local government in managing flood and forest and land fire haze. Data were collected qualitatively from government officials through focus group discussions (FGDs) and interviews. The findings showed that the capacity of Jambiâ€™s local government needs to be improved, and there are issues to be solved. Jambi Province policy capacity tended to focus on forest fires and lacked attention on flood-related policies. On implementation capacity, there exist some issues to be overcome, such as the local government officialsâ€™ knowledge and skills related to disaster risk management, redundant disaster preparedness programs at the village level, and the need for more detailed hazard maps.Â ",0

In February 2009 she was operated on, in another center, by total colectomy with subsequent ileostomy due to refractoriness to medical therapy (steroids and azathioprine). Two months after there was the onset of a peristomal lesion compatible with a peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). The diagnosis was established after dermatological consultation. In July 2009 she underwent to recanalization. In October 2009 the PG was initially treated with infliximab (IFX), with a dose regimen of 5 mg/kg at 0 and 2 weeks and then monthly until January 2010, with regression of the peristomal lesion. In May 2010 there was a recurrence of the peristomal PG, which was again treated with IFX, adopting the same regimen, but without regression of the lesion. Furthermore, in November 2010 there was the appearance of another two lesions, on the left tibia zone and on the right abdominal wall; thus, IFX was stopped. Therapy was again started with corticosteroids, without any clinical improvement. In December 2010 there was a recurrence of UC, with the onset of bloody diarrhea and the further appearance of another lesion, similar to the others, on the right thigh; thus, she was referred to our unit. At admission she presented, in the above-mentioned anatomical sites, with painful ulcers with violaceous, inflammatory, undermined borders with pustules on a necrotic base, the largest ones with a diameter of 12 7 cm, on the abdominal wall (Fig. 1). A further dermatological consultation confirmed again the diagnosis of PG. Bacterial cultures of the ulcers were negative. Her bowel complaints regressed after treatment with corticosteroid. Immunosuppressive treatment was also started with oral cyclosporin A (CsA) (5 mg/kg), based on the diagnosis of PG and the refractoriness of the previous treatment with IFX, obtaining a gradual morphologic and symptomatologic regression of the lesions. The patient was discharged with an indication to continue the immunosuppressive treatment with oral CsA, monitoring the cyclosporinemia every 2 weeks, and slowly tapering corticosteroids. At the first outpatient control, 2 weeks after discharge, the two lesions on the abdominal wall were in initial regression, while the lesion on the left tibia and on the right thigh were improved but not completely regressed. The dosage of CsA was optimal (156 ng/mL), while the bowel complaint of the patient was constantly in remission. At the last outpatient control, in June 2011, she was in optimal clinical and nutritional status, and both the intestinal and the dermatological complaints (Fig. 2) were in remission. The prevailing therapeutic strategy of PG is based on systemic immunosuppression, using corticosteroids, CsA, or biologic therapy. However, no trial has compared the efficacy of different immunosuppressive drugs. CsA, at doses ranging from 3 to 5 mg/kg/day, has been shown to be effective in case reports, published FIGURE 1.

DSG was discovered in Japan and was proved to be a novel immunosuppressant in various animal transplantation models. The immunosuppressive mechanism of DSG is unclear yet, but its point of action is supposed to be in the early immuno response to allogeneic stimulation without the regulation of cytokine production. We performed the administration of DSG in fifteen patients, who had rejection episodes, with a dosage of 3 mg/kg/day or 5 mg/kg/day for five days by drip infusion. In the group of recipients who had rejection episodes within six months after kidney transplantation, DSG proved effective on six out of seven acute rejection episodes and induced favorable remission. And in the group of recipients who had rejection episodes after six months since kidney transplantation, DSG proved effective on all of ten rejection episodes. There was not a difference of effectiveness in respect to the dosage of DSG. The side effect of DSG treatment was mainly leukopenia but in most cases these leukopenia was remitted just under careful observation. Some patients complained the sense of abdominal discomfort. But so far, we did not encounter serious or critical side effects and complications during all the time of progression. Another benefit was that DSG was able to reverse the rejection episode even in the patient who had already treated with anti lymphocyte globulin and/or anti CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3. We concluded that the administration of DSG as a rescue therapy was not accompanied by the serious side effects and was most effective against acute rejection after kidney transplantation.",0

Diets with a high glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) have been hypothesized to increase oxidative stress, but the limited human studies are inconsistent.


Objective
The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate associations between dietary GI, GL, and carbohydrate intake and oxidative stress, as measured by F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs).


Methods
Concentrations of F2-IsoP and its metabolite (15-F2t-IsoP-M) were measured in urine samples collected at enrollment from 866 premenopausal women (aged 35-54 y) participating in the Sister Study. Total carbohydrate intake and dietary GI and GL were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Urinary F2-IsoP and 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations were compared across quintiles of carbohydrate intake, GI, and GL using multivariable linear regression models.


Results
Urinary F2-IsoP concentrations were positively associated with dietary GI (P-trend = 0.023), and both F2-IsoP and 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations were positively associated with GL (F2-IsoP: P-trend < 0.001; 15-F2t-IsoP-M: P-trend < 0.001) and total carbohydrate intake (F2-IsoP: P-trend = 0.012; 15-F2t-IsoP-M: P-trend < 0.001). Stratified analyses suggested that a positive association between GI and urinary 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations was present among women with a body mass index [BMI (in kg/m2)] ≥30.0, but not among those with a BMI of <25.0 or 25.0-29.9 (P-interaction = 0.01).


Conclusions
Our cross-sectional analyses in a sample of premenopausal women support hypothesized relations between high dietary GI and GL and oxidative stress, as assessed by urinary F2-IsoP and 15-F2t-IsoP-M concentrations. Given potential associations between oxidative stress and the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, our findings may have important implications for reducing chronic disease risk.",0

A superior DC vaccine should: possess extensive expression of co-stimulatory molecules, have an exceptional type-1 polarization capacity characterized by their ability to produce IL-12p70 upon contact with responding T cells, migrate efficiently toward chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) ligands, and have a superior capacity to activate cytotoxic T cell responses. A major advance has been achieved with the discovery of the next generation maturation protocol involving TLR-3 agonist (poly I:C), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IFN-α, and has since been known as α-type-1 maturation cocktail. We demonstrate how this combination can be greatly enhanced by the inclusion of a TLR-8 stimulation (R848), thereby contributing to potentiation between different TLR signaling pathways. For maximum efficiency, TLR-3 stimulation should precede (termed pre I:C) the stimulation with the R848/TNF-α/IL-1β/IFN-α/IFN-γ cocktail. When compared to DCs matured with α-type-1 maturation cocktail (αDCs), DCs matured with pre I:C/R848/TNF-α/IL-1β/IFN-α/IFN-γ (termed zDCs) displayed higher expression of CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules. Importantly, after CD40-ligand stimulation, which simulates DC-T cell contact, zDCs were much more proficient in IL-12p70 production. In comparison to αDCs, zDCs also displayed a significantly greater migratory capacity toward chemokine ligands (CCL)19 and CCL21, and had a significantly greater allo-stimulatory capacity. Finally, zDCs were also superior in their capacity to induce melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells, CD8+ T cell proliferation, and cytotoxic T cells, which produced approximately two times more IFN-γ and more granzyme B, than those stimulated with αDCs. In conclusion, we present a novel and superior DC maturation cocktail that could be easily implemented into next generation DC vaccine manufacturing protocols in future trials.",0

Survival rate varies depending on several factors, but is rather favorable, with radiotherapy as the treatment of choice. Irradiation of the craniospinal axis results, however, in severe neuropsychological and psychosocial impairments pertaining to memory, attention, motor functioning, language, and visuospatial abilities. Precise mechanisms underlying the formation of medulloblastoma are still unclear, but implication of at least three signaling molecules is postulated: insulin‐like growth factor‐I, WNT, and Sonic hedgehog. Thanks to increasing knowledge on the cellular mechanisms contributing to tumor formation, it is possible to propose new therapies that could replace radiotherapy or allow decreasing irradiation doses.

After reviewing the assumptions and mean-field type approximations involved in the construction of chemical rate equations for uniform reactant densities, we first discuss spatial clustering in birth-death systems, where non-linearities are introduced through either density-limiting pair reactions, or equivalently via local imposition of finite carrying capacities. The competition of offspring production, death, and non-linear inhibition induces a population extinction threshold, which represents a non-equilibrium phase transition that separates active from absorbing states. This continuous transition is characterized by the universal scaling exponents of critical directed percolation clusters. Next we focus on the emergence of depletion zones in single-species annihilation processes and spatial population segregation with the associated reaction fronts in two-species pair annihilation. These strong (anti-)correlation effects are dynamically generated by the underlying stochastic kinetics. Finally, we address noise-induced and fluctuation-stabilized spatio-temporal patterns in basic predator-prey systems, exemplified by spreading activity fronts in the two-species Lotka-Volterra model as well as spiral structures in the May-Leonard variant of cyclically competing three-species systems akin to rock-paper-scissors games.",0

In this second study we tested the hypothesis that HBO and NBOreox increase orthodromic activity of CA1 neurons (oPS, orthodromic population spike) and OxIP via a combination of both increased excitatory synaptic transmission (field excitatory postsynaptic potential, fEPSP) and intrinsic excitability (antidromic population spike, aPS). HBO and NBOreox increased the oPS but rarely increased or potentiated the fEPSP. HBO exposure produced epileptiform antidromic activity, which was abolished during inhibition of fast GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Decreasing O2 from 0.95 ATA (control) to 0.6 ATA (intermediate O2) or 0.0 ATA (hypoxia) reversibly abolished the fEPSP, and reoxygenation rarely induced potentiation of the fEPSP or aPS. Intracellular recordings and antidromic field potential recordings, however, revealed that synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability were preserved, albeit at lower levels, in 0.60 ATA O2. Together, these data indicate that 1) the changes in excitatory postsynaptic activity are not required for stimulation of the oPS during and HBO/NBOreox or for activation of OxIP, suggesting the latter is a form of intrinsic plasticity; 2) HBO disinhibits spontaneous synaptic transmission to induce epileptiform activity; and 3) although synchronous synaptic activation of the CA1 neuronal population requires hyperoxia (i.e., 0.95 ATA O2), synaptic activation of individual CA1 neurons does not.",0

Mice were fed with either a HFD or a control diet for 8 weeks. Half of HFD-mice received daily supplementation of PUA. Supplementation with PUA ameliorated the liver steatosis and obesity in mice fed by HFD, as demonstrated by the decreased hepatic triglyceride accumulation, body weight gain and fat weight. A HFD increased the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, whereas supplementation with PUA effectively restored it. PUA supplementation counteracted the upregulation in family Desulfovibrionaceae and Helicobacteraceae, and the downregulation in Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae induced by HFD. Correspondingly, the family of Desulfovibrionaceae was positively related, whereas Muribaculaceae was negatively related to the amount of epididymal and perirenal fat, and the level of liver triglyceride and total cholesterol. The family Helicobacteraceae was also positively related to the amount of epididymal and perirenal fat. Moreover, PUA supplementation counteracted the increase in the population of Anaerotruncus, Faecalibaculim, Mucispirillum, and the decrease in the population of Lactobacillus, Roseburia, Oscillibacter at the genus level induced by HFD.

Its implementation, however, confronts a dilemma of either introducing more computational load by explicitly calculating the second partial derivative term or sacrificing the accuracy by loosening the association between the cost-to-go and its derivatives. This article aims at increasing the online learning efficiency of GDHP while retaining its analytical accuracy by introducing a novel GDHP design based on a critic network and an associated dual network. This associated dual network is derived from the critic network explicitly and precisely, and its structure is in the same level of complexity as dual heuristic programming critics. Three simulation experiments are conducted to validate the learning ability, efficiency, and feasibility of the proposed GDHP critic design.",0

Since the industrial revolution, energy expenditure related to economic activity and domestic life has fallen progressively as technological innovation has replaced muscular power with labor-saving devices. This fall in activity energy expenditure however has not been associated over this entire period with population weight gain. In the 1970s and the 1980s, there was an abrupt uptick in the rate of rise of relative weight in industrialized countries followed rapidly by developing countries. This has led to high and increasing rates of overweight and obesity in high-income countries worldwide, but also an alarming inclusion of low- and middle-income populations in this obesity epidemic. The precise drivers of these concurrent epidemics are not agreed, but probably include on the one hand an increase in dietary energy intake resulting from the impact of industrialization and globalization on food availability and price. On the other, there is the facilitating underlying status of a steadily falling activity energy expenditure as muscle power as an input into economic production as well as household and leisure activities has been supplanted. The rise in population weight without accompanying linear growth manifests as obesity. The accretion of fat as well as the response to other environmental exposures during progressive industrialization and modernization has evoked an accompanying epidemic of cardiometabolic pathology that has significant impact on health as well as macroeconomics. Given the power and presumed irreversibility of industrialization and globalization, our ability to reverse these obesity epidemics is heavily dependent on new knowledge being developed which gives insight with prevention and therapeutic implications on the proximal and distal drivers of this progressive positive energy balance.",0

This system uses the relative position between the user and displays in order to show the content perpendicularly to the user's point of view in a deformation-free fashion. We introduce the image created by the portable projector as a new, temporary and movable image in the perspective corrected MDE, creating a more flexible workspace to the user. In our study, we combined two ways of using the projector (handheld or head-mounted) with two ways of moving the cursor on the screens (using a mouse or a laser-pointing based strategy), proposing four techniques to be tried by the users. Also, two exploratory evaluation experiments were performed in order to evaluate our system. The first experiment (5 participants) aimed to evaluate how using a movable screen in order to fill the gaps between displays affects the performance of the user in a cross-display pointing task; while the second (6 participants) aimed to evaluate how using the projector to extend the workspace impacts the task completion time in an off-screen content recognition task. Our results showed that while no significant improvement of the performance of the users could be seen on the pointing task, the users were significantly faster when recognizing off-screen content. Also, the introduction of the portable projector reduced the overall task load on both tasks.",0

Extracting information on the control of motor units (MU) is difficult when using single channels, e.g., due to the low selectivity and large phase cancellations of MU action potentials (MUAPs). In this paper, we propose a new method to face this problem in the case of a single differential channel. The signal is approximated as a sum of convolutions of different kernels (adapted to the signal) and firing patterns, whose sum is the estimation of the cumulative MU firings. Three simulators were used for testing: muscles of parallel fibres with either two innervation zones (IZs, thus, with MUAPs of different phases) or one IZ and a model with fibres inclined with respect to the skin. Simulations were prepared for different fat thicknesses, distributions of conduction velocity, maximal firing rates, synchronizations of MU discharges, and variability of the inter-spike interval. The performances were measured in terms of cross-correlations of the estimated and simulated cumulative MU firings in the range of 0–50 Hz and compared with those of a state-of-the-art single-kernel algorithm. The median cross-correlations for multi-kernel/single-kernel approaches were 92.2%/82.4%, 98.1%/97.6%, and 95.0%/91.0% for the models with two IZs, one IZ (parallel fibres), and inclined fibres, respectively (all statistically significant differences, which were larger when the MUAP shapes were of greater difference).",0

Cranes are widely used in this sector for several activities. A wrong load lifting or handling often is due to a limited visibility of working area and could bring to severe accidental scenarios, for this reason safety of these operations becomes of paramount importance. The use of safety devices, that provide an augmented vision to the crane-operator, is essential to avoid potential accidents, moreover risk analysis could benefit from the acquisition of real time information about the process. This work aims to extrapolate and adapt dynamic risk assessment concepts for crane-related operations of a typical oil and gas industry by means of the support of safety devices. To achieve this objective, a set of risk indicators, reporting continuous information about the operations that are carried out, will be defined; successively, a technique of aggregation of these indicators will also be applied with the aim to update the frequency of critical events by a proper Risk Metric Reduction Factor that accounts for the effect of the use of safety barriers.",0

Norwich Pharmacal orders are primarily used for finding the identity of an unknown potential defendant. They can only be sought against a person who facilitated and got ‘mixed up’ in the wrongdoing. Norwich Pharmacal orders therefore cannot be made against ‘mere witnesses’. Pre-action disclosure orders bring forward the time when disclosure of documents takes place to the period before a claim is issued. Disclosure against non-parties enables the court to order a witness to produce documents in advance of the trial, thus avoiding adjournments when documents are produced at the last minute at trial.",0

This report presents results from a surviving porcine beating heart model in which transapical access sites were closed using an automated suturing technique ultimately intended for percutaneous use. Methods Through an approved protocol including general anesthesia, the cardiac apex in 10 beating pig hearts was surgically exposed, permitting transapical passage of a 0.035-in guidewire and a 5.5F, 0.9-mL Fogarty balloon catheter. An automated suturing device was passed over the guidewire and the Fogarty onto the transapical access site. Two pledgeted horizontal mattress sutures were simultaneously placed concentrically around the apical access site with a single squeeze of the device's lever. A 25F dilator was passed into the left ventricle over the guidewire and subsequently removed. The sutures were then secured using pledgeted titanium knots. Chest wall and skin incisions were closed. The animals were recovered from anesthesia and resumed a normal diet. Results Under general anesthesia, the transapical access site of each animal was re-exposed, five at 1-week and five at 2-week intervals. Hemostasis was complete, and all wounds healed well. Conclusions The evaluation of transapical wound closures in this surviving porcine heart model demonstrates complete hemostasis and excellent healing through the use of this automated remote suturing technology.",0

Termed gel-liquid interfacial polymerization (GLIP), the resulting PA films are measured to be chemically and mechanically analogous to the active layer in thin film composite membranes. PA thin films are prepared using the GLIP process on both a morphologically homogeneous hydrogel prepared from poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (PHEMA) and a phase-separated, heterogeneous hydrogel prepared from poly(acrylamide) (PAAm). Two monomer systems are examined: trimesoyl chloride (TMC) reacting with m-phenylene diamine (MPD) and TMC reacting with piperazine (PIP). Unlike the self-limiting growth behavior in TFC membrane fabrication, diffusion-limited, continuous growth of the PA films is observed, where both the thickness and roughness of the PA layers increase with reaction time. A key morphological difference is found between the two monomer systems using the GLIP process: TMC/MPD produces a ridge-and-valley surface morphology whereas TMC/PIP produces nodule/granular structures. The GLIP process represents a unique opportunity to not only explore the pore characteristics (size, spacing, and continuity) on the resulting structure and morphology of interfacially polymerized thin films, but also a method to modify the surface of (or encapsulate) hydrogels.",0

The metaphor in the Mandiri Securitas advertisement contains cinematographic images that borrow keris culture to be sided with banking culture. This qualitative descriptive study uses a semiotic approach to appropriate verbal and visual messages from the system of rhetorical marks ""Minus One"". The content of visual rhetoric and verbal rhetoric on the Mandiri Securitas advertisement was reviewed by Roland Barthes's semiotic theory, because it was considered capable of uncovering the relationship of the sign meaning behind the denotative marker system and connotative markers from the ideology of Mandiri Securitas advertisements with the  theme of empu keris (keris maker). The results of this study prove that the application of the ""Minus-One"" method is very helpful to find and recognize the roles played by the constituent elements of a film construction.

Specifically, the study focuses on changes in the quoted spread and quoted depth following the fraud announcement.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses a unique set of fraud sample using enforcement action releases (EARs) identified from the Security Commission of Malaysia and Bursa Malaysia. To estimate the result, the authors use event study methodology, OLS regression and simultaneous model on a set of 67 fraudulent firms.FindingsThe results of event study, OLS regression and simultaneous equation models suggest that information asymmetry increases on fraud discovery. The authors also use the analysis on subsamples classified by the type of regulator (who issued the enforcement release) and type of fraud committed. However, the authors find no evidence of a difference in information asymmetry across these groups. Overall, the results support the reputational view of fraud that it damages the firms’ reputation and increases uncertainty in the capital market.Research limitations/implicationsThese findings provide valuable insights into understanding the information asymmetry around fraud announcements, especially for Malaysia, where the majority of the public-listed companies are family-controlled and under significant state control. The results of this study call for the active role that regulators can play to achieve a transparent and liquid capital market.Practical implicationsThe research has practical implications. Specifically, for Malaysia, fraud is the primary area for National Results Areas (NKRA) in the Government Transformation Program (GTP). Therefore, for regulators and policymakers to ensure a liquid and transparent capital market, identifying the factors that elicit the fraudulent behavior and improving the related governance mechanism are necessary steps to prevent the fraudulent practices.Social implicationsDue to increased information asymmetry on fraud announcements, the demand for equity decreases that may affect not only the fraudulent firms but also results in negative externality for non-fraudulent firms, thus impairing their ability to fund equity.Originality/valueA significant majority of studies have focused on corporate frauds in developed countries such as the USA that is characterized by dispersed ownership system and a strong capital market. One of the vocal critics of the agency theory is that it neglects the social and institutional framework within which companies operate. In emerging markets, such as Malaysia, the published academic papers on fraud and information asymmetry are very limited. As emerging markets practice different cultures, corporate governance mechanisms and market regulations, the study is significant to investigate the behavior of investors in such markets.",0

This essay further examines the status of digital parties as movement parties that have a dual purpose: to win the electoral game and to radically reform the system of representative democracy once they are in power.

 For treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM), flow cytometry has become a widely used and valuable method for the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow. Use of an optimized single-tube, 10-color flow cytometry panel for assessment of MM MRD has shown to be beneficial in patient monitoring and has shown correlation to the acknowledged EuroFlow 8-color, 2-tube method. In order to further correlate levels of MM and relapse in patients, validation of a sensitive MM MRD assay that can be applied to testing for residual disease in apheresis product prior to autologous stem cell transplant, a standard treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. This approach can exhibit great value in patient monitoring and treatment. As new combination therapies are developed for treatment of multiple myeloma in concert with autologous stem cell transplantation, evaluation of MRD in apheresis will likely continue to grow in importance. The purpose of this study is to show the validation and sensitivity of a flow cytometry assay designed to detect Multiple Myeloma (MM) cells in G-CSF and other mobilized apheresis samples from human Multiple Myeloma patients. Using GSM-mobilized apheresis product, spiked with different levels of patient de-identified MM plasma cells, validation of a 10-color MM MRD panel can be evaluated, intended to mimic patient apheresis at varying levels of residual disease post treatment. As with any minimal residual disease assessment, a high number of events are required to ensure sensitivity and precision. Typically, acquisition of 3-5 x 107 events is required to ensure precision of MM MRD levels to 0.001%.

Although the percentages of surface IgM-bearing cells were not reduced, the numbers of IgM-secreting cells were markedly reduced. The membrane-bound mu (microns) and secreted mu (microseconds) mRNAs are produced from transcripts of a single immunoglobulin mu gene by alternative RNA processing pathways. The control of microseconds mRNA synthesis depends on the addition of poly(A) to microseconds C-terminal segment. In both patients, mu mRNA was well detected but microseconds C-terminal mRNA was scarcely detected, suggesting that microns mRNA was well transcribed but microseconds mRNA was not. There was, at least, no mutation or deletion in the microseconds C-terminal coding sequence, the RNA splice site (GG/TAAAC) at the 5' end of microseconds C-terminal segment and the AATAAA poly(A) signal sequence in both patients. Our results suggest that selective IgM deficiency in Bloom's syndrome is due to an abnormality in the maturation of surface IgM-bearing B cells into IgM-secreting cells and a failure of microseconds mRNA synthesis. Moreover, reduced microseconds mRNA synthesis may be due to the defect on developmental regulation of the site at which poly(A) is added to transcripts of the mu gene.",0

Coma is the disorder of consciousness because of the damage to diffused bilateral cerebral hemisphere cortex or reticular activating system. Coma can be caused by neurogenic (head brain injury), metabolic (endogenic), and toxic (exogenic) factors. To determine the cause of metabolic and toxic coma, laboratory tests are performed; in case of neurogenic coma, the neurologic examination is essential, when five systems are evaluated: the level of consciousness (according to Glasgow Coma Scale or Full Outline of Unresponsiveness Scale), photoreaction of pupils and ophthalmoscopic examination, oculomotoric, motoric, and cardiopulmonary systems. For the treatment of coma, adequate oxygenation and correction of blood circulation disorders are important. The treatment of metabolic coma is guided by special schemes; antidotes often are needed in the treatment of toxic coma, and surgery helps if traumatic brain injury is present. The prognosis and outcomes of the comatose patient depend on the age and comorbid diseases of the patient, the underlying cause of coma, timely medical help and its quality, and intensive treatment and care of the patient in coma.",0

The results then have revealed that the major portion of chinoform is excreted into urine in the form of glucuronic acid conjugate. Therefore, in order to maintain the toxicity of chinoform in vivo, it is necessary to increase the amount of free chinoform in the body. As a step towards this purpose the administration of carbon tetrachloride into rats would be feasible. It can be assumed that in the carbon tetrachloride-induced fattey liver as a result of liver disturbances the conjugating ability of glucuronic acid is decreased (a decrease of activated glucuronic acid) and glucuronic acid bound chinoform decreases but free chinoform increases. In the present study we induced carbon tetrachloride fatty liver in rats and then injected intravenously 1311-chinoform to these animals to determine whether or not the ratio of free chinoform to conjugate chinonorm would increase. The results are presented as follows.",0

Of particular interest is the enigmatic high comorbidity of OSA with epilepsy, the exact underlying pathophysiology of which remains elusive despite a multitude of research performed in the last four decades. Hypoxaemia, which is an important characteristic feature found in OSA during apnoeic spells, has been implicated in the high comorbidity of OSA with epilepsy, the basis of which rests upon hypoxaemia‐mediated brain damage, subcortical release phenomenon, oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory reactions. However, several studies present contradictory evidences that potentially refute the hypoxaemia‐based mechanism. Additionally, the role of hypercapnia thatgenerally accompanies hypoxaemia during apnoeic spells, cannot be overlooked and is known to be potentially protective against neuronal hyperexcitability. Thus, hypoxaemia theory implicated in the high comorbidity of OSA and epilepsy appears weak and refutable. This brief paper studies and critically analyses the role of hypoxaemia in conjunction with hypercapnia in the underlying pathophysiology of the comorbidity.",0

In order to identify sustainable, aesthetic, economic as well as structurally efficient options, we assessed several key performance indicators in real time. By automatically estimating steel and concrete volumes, a simple, yet suitable approximation of the embodied carbon (considering 85-95%) can be obtained at a very early design stage.

Thus, a better understanding of how RAS proteins localize to and distribute on the PM is critical to better comprehend RAS biology and to develop new strategies to treat RAS pathology. In this review, we discuss recent findings on how RAS proteins sort lipids as they undergo macromolecular assembly on the PM.

Many methods of specifying spinal curvature have been proposed, but they often involve qualitative assessment or a large number of parameters. The objective of this study was to develop a quantitative method of characterizing cervical-spine curvature using a small number of parameters. 180 sagittal X-rays of subjects seated in automotive posture with their necks in neutral, flexed, and extended postures were collected in the early 1970s. Subjects were selected to represent a range of statures and ages for each gender. X-rays were reanalyzed using advanced technology and statistical methods. Coordinates of the posterior margins of the vertebral bodies and dens were digitized. Bézier splines were fit through the coordinates of these points. The interior control points that define the spline curvature were parameterized as a vector angle and length. By defining the length as a function of the angle, cervical-spine curvature was defined with just two parameters: superior and inferior Bézier angles. A classification scheme was derived to sort each curvature by magnitude and type of curvature (lordosis versus S-shaped versus kyphosis; inferior or superior location). Cervical-spine curvature in an automotive seated posture varies with gender and age but not stature. Average values of superior and inferior Bézier angles for cervical spines in flexion, neutral, and extension automotive postures are presented for each gender and age group. Use of Bézier splines fit through posterior margins offers a quantitative method of characterizing cervical-spine curvature using two parameters: superior and inferior Bézier angles.",0

Cotylenin A, a fusicoccane diterpene glycoside with a complex sugar moiety, was isolated as a plant-growth regulator. Cotylenin A has been shown to inhibit the growth of various cancer cells. Herein, we examined the anti-myeloma effects of cotylenin A using five human myeloma cell lines (RPMI-8226, KMS-11, KMS-26, KMS-12 PE and KMS-12 BM) and xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Cotylenin A and vincristine synergistically inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis in myeloma cells. While other microtubule-disturbing agents also showed co-operative effects with cotylenin A, other anticancer agents, such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, camptothecin, methotrexate, gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil, did not show such co-operation with cotylenin A. These differences might be attributed to the effects on autophagic responses. Combined treatment with cotylenin A and vincristine induced autophagy (formation of LC3-II and degradation of p62 protein). However, doxorubicin did not enhance the autophagy induced by cotylenin A. A colony-forming assay indicated that the combined treatment with cotylenin A and vincristine more effectively suppressed the formation of large colonies, which have higher self-renewal activity than vincristine alone. Expression of pluripotency-associated transcription factor Sox2 mRNA in RPMI-8226 myeloma cells was significantly suppressed by treatment with cotylenin A. Combined treatment with cotylenin A and vincristine significantly inhibited the growth of KMS-26 myeloma cells as xenografts. Our results suggest that the combination of cotylenin A and vincristine may have therapeutic value. Recently, it was reported that cotylenin A modulates the 14-3-3 intracellular signaling pathway. The 14-3-3 proteins may be novel targets in treating myeloma. However, our study could not explain how the sensitization to vincristine is related to the effects of cotylenin A on the 14-3-3 signaling pathway and further studies will be needed.",0

The trabecular meshwork and aqueous plexus of the experimental rabbits' eyes were examined under transmission electron microscope on various post-operative days: 3 days, 1, 3 and 4 weeks. It was discovered that the corneo-scleral and uveal trabecular meshworks were obviously distended and their core collagenous and elastoid fibers were hyperplastic, the phenomenon being more marked with the prolongation of the duration of the intraocular hypertension. Many endothelial cells were detached from the trabecular cords and freely located in the intertrabecular spaces. Persistent hyperplasia of collagenous fibers and accumulation of extracellular plague materials occurred in the endothelial meshwork, leading to its compactness. The giant vacuoles in the endothelial cells lining the inner wall of the canal of aqueous plexus were gradually decreased in number and the cytoplasm of the cells became attenuated and some fenestrations appeared. The results show that the main site of the resistance of the aqueous outflow occurring during intraocular hypertension is at endothelial meshwork and the above experimental morphological changes are quite similar to those of glaucoma patients.",0

By deriving the probability density function of fluctuant wind speed and investigating the probability density curve, we decompose the fluctuant wind power into the steady fluctuation and peak fluctuation. The steady fluctuation has the low power value and leads to great energy variation. However, the peak fluctuation whose power value is high induces the small energy fluctuation. At the end of this paper, we give a calculation example to illuminate the decomposition of wind power fluctuation. Based on the wind power decomposition, the proper suppression method and control algorithm can be developed to not only realize the real-time wind power suppression but also reduce the investment cost.

Its monetary significance is evidenced by the economic burden imposed on health care systems, given that the cost of medical care for a patient that has suffered a stroke is around $25,741 US dollars every 5 years (Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2012). A stroke occurs as a result of a disturbance or interruption of cerebral blood flow that significantly reduces the supply of oxygen and glucose to the neural tissue. Consequently, several cell death mechanisms (secondary lesion mechanisms) such as necrosis, excitotoxicity, free radical production and inflammation are triggered (Castillo, 2000). Over the last decades, a variety of therapies with thrombolytic, neuroprotective, and restorative properties have been investigated. However, the results of these studies appear to be limited. That is the case of the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) – the first line of treatment for decades – which is associated with low rates of recanalization and high rates of morbidity. Also, endovascular intervention, particularly mechanical thrombectomy, has been proposed as a promising therapeutic adjunct to tPA for the treatment of stroke; however, until recently, the efficacy of this therapeutic approach has been controversial (Ding, 2015). Innovative theurapeutic options are currently being developed in order to restore affected neuronal circuits following a cerebral ischemic event. Some of these innovative therapeutic approaches are based on stem cell transplantation and/or induction of neurogenesis.",0

We would like to respond to the recent “letter to the editor” by Abbas et al. If you had conducted a similar research in an earlier published article, you would have to increase your sample size. But, we did not find any researches that could be a reference for our research. Only in Macones’ study, 7–8% of women in each group were induced with dinoprostone [Cervidil] [1]. It is obvious that the number of patients in our study is more than that. Although we have taken this study as a reference in our manuscript; we have not mentioned the samples size based on it. In fact, the principles of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not been generally accepted. You are right, it would be better to specify in the text which patients were excluded from the study. There were 13 cases discovered to have cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) and delivered by cesarean section. But they were not macrosomic babies. I wonder how such an idea got before Abbas did not see the data. There was only one macrosomic baby (4522 g) without gestational diabetes. We reported the rate of Apgar score less than seven as one of the secondary outcomes; and we did not miss to present this outcome. You can see these results in Table 3. Zeynep Kamil Education and Research Hospital is a reference hospital for follow-up and management at high-risk pregnancies. The number of births is between 700 and 800 every month. It is the biggest hospital for gynecology and obstetric in Istanbul. Majority of births are in high-risk pregnancies. Author stated that abnormally distributed data should be presented as median (IQ Range). Nominal or ordinal data which are not measurement data can be described as median (IQ Range). However, a scale or measurement data may be described as both mean SS and median (IQ Range). We used M-WU test because the data distribution was not normal and did not meet the assumptions of the t-test. Most of articles in respective and high impact factor journals use mean SS for abnormally distributed data. It would be better to report the median and IQR. NORMALITY and CONTINUITY are different concepts in mathematics and statistics. One of them determines the type of difference analysis results, other determines type of data.

The finished goods inventory may be analysed by the methods of classical inventory theory in order to characterize the trade-off between inventory costs and schedule stability. A model is formulated in which the supply of finished goods is replenished by a small fixed quantity each time period. The size of the replenishment quantity may be revised only at pre-specified intervals. The single-interval problem is analysed, the cost-minimizing value of the replenishment quantity for a given revision interval length is computed, and the optimal cost is characterized as a function of the revision interval length. The dynamic problem is shown to be convex, with relatively easily computed optima. Finally, alternative formulations of the problem are described and suggestions made for further research.",0

The authors argue that object reference parameters should be supported in such systems for reasons of programming style and productivity. It is not sufficient to pass the name of an object as a string. The system must be aware of reference parameters and provide means to control and protect the delegation of access. The authors' emphasis is on motivating the need for protected object references and on showing that their efficient implementation is feasible in diverse environments. The design is guided by the principle of minimal trust. Two prototype implementations of object reference support systems are presented. One is an example in which, right from the start, object references are integrated into the design of a kernel for a network operating system for heterogeneous distributed environments. The other prototype shows how object references can be added to a popular remote procedure call package in an upwardly compatible way. >",0

Who will be the next residency program director? We don’t typically place a priority on succession planning in our departments and often are forced to make a quick decision to fill a position when there is a medical leave, an unplanned move to another city, or another unexpected turn of events. 
 
Succession planning is routine in the executive levels of corporations and health systems but is not typical on the department level. White and Enright recently repeated their survey of pharmacists to determine whether the leadership crisis numbers had changed from the 2005 survey results.1 Given the number of pharmacy directors who plan to retire in the next decade, it is estimated that the profession will need about 4,600 individuals for pharmacy director positions, which represents 77% of the current pharmacy directors. This is slightly lower than the 80% of current directors who were planning to retire in the next decade from the 2005 survey. A positive from the repeat survey is that 45% of present practitioners are currently considering leadership positions, up from 30% of practitioners who were considering leadership positions in 2005. It is good news that more practitioners are considering leadership positions, and we must continue to foster leadership development at all levels (students, new practitioners, clinical staff, and seasoned practitioners) to manage the complexities of today’s health system pharmacy. 
 
Start a conversation in your department on the philosophy of succession planning about the reasons for succession planning and how the plan will be used. Planning for coverage during scheduled time off or a planned absence is different than planning for a permanent replacement, and both scenarios require a time investment. You will identify that key positions may be unique to your leadership structure, and the talents of a technician manager, residency program director, and lead workers should be considered part of the succession plan. You will also identify those who can step into leadership roles immediately and those who can be successful with additional development. 
 
How do we mobilize the 45% of current practitioners who are considering leadership positions? Start by identifying who these individuals are – almost half of your current staff may be interested in a leadership position! Find an opportunity to ask the question either directly (Have you considered a leadership position?) or indirectly (Where do you see your next position taking you?). Think back to those individuals who are always willing to take on a new project, learn a new skill, or pick up the extra student on rotation unexpectedly – they should be targeted for increased responsibility within the department. 
 
Assess the talent of individuals on your team today and use a gap analysis to help determine growth and development opportunities for them. Develop talent through coaching and mentoring, beginning with open and honest dialogue about the organization and the department. Set the next generation up for success by guiding them when possible instead of adopting the “sink or swim” philosophy as they try on leadership roles. Help them understand what to expect in a given situation or how to handle an unfamiliar group or circumstance. Role play or practice a conversation to help work through uncomfortable or new situations. Allow them to fix problems, develop workflow, or propose solutions, but take the time to debrief them after the fact to allow them to grow with each new experience. 
 
You can continue the leadership development of some individuals by, for example, suggesting they join a multidisciplinary committee and represent the department. Set expectations to help the leaders-in-training understand their role on the committee; let them know what resources are available. Have them report back to you or others on the management team about the committee direction or goals. 
 
To help identify the next practitioner to coach or mentor, start a leadership book club or other informal meetings to get to know your team better. Select an easy read for the book club; Whack a Mole (David Marx) or Checklist Manifesto (Atul Gawande) are easy to pick up and apply to any health care setting. Share stories of how you and the individuals on your leadership team grew into your current roles. Formal education (advanced degree) or organized leadership training (residency, fellowship, or the Pharmacy Leadership Academy) may have been part of your path; support team members who may be interested in similar opportunities. Many organizations have leadership development programs for new managers through the human resource department, which offers another chance for a practitioner to network with others in the organization. Shadowing is another way to give interested leadership candidates insight into this new role. 
 
An estimated 45% of current practitioners are considering leadership positions, and we will have at least 4,600 formal leader positions to fill in the next 10 years. Identify the needs of your department and begin your succession plan. There are current practitioners interested in leadership who are waiting for the conversation.",0

This study examined changes in the sex differences in performance across time in female and male master runners competing in a mountain marathon compared to a flat city marathon. Methods The association between age and performance of finishers in the Jungfrau Marathon, Switzerland, with 1830 meter changes in altitude and a flat city marathon (Lausanne Marathon), Switzerland, were analyzed from 2000 to 2011. Results In both events, athletes in the 35–44 years age group showed the highest number of finishers. In the mountain marathon, the number of female master runners aged > 35 years increased in contrast to female finishers aged < 35 years, while the number of male finishers was unchanged in all age groups. In the city marathon, the number of female finishers was unchanged while the number of male finishers in the age groups for 25–34-year-olds and 35–44-year-olds decreased. In female marathoners, performance improved in athletes aged 35–44 and 55–64 years in the city marathon. Male marathoners improved race time in age group 45–54 years in both the city marathon and the mountain marathon. Female master runners reduced the sex difference in performance in the 45–54-year age group in both competitions and in the 35–44-year age group in the mountain marathon. The sex difference in performance decreased in the 35–44-year age group from 19.1% ± 4.7% to 16.6% ± 1.9% in the mountain marathon (r2 = 0.39, P = 0.03). In age groups 45–54 years, the sex difference decreased from 23.4% ± 1.9% to 15.9% ± 6.1% in the mountain marathon (r2 = 0.39, P < 0.01) and from 34.7% ± 4.6% to 11.8% ± 6.2% in the city marathon (r2 = 0.39, P < 0.01). Conclusion These findings suggest that female master runners aged 35–54 years reduced sex differences in their performance in both mountain and city marathon running.",0

Autophagy has been reported to play important roles in tumorigenesis. This meta-analysis was conducted in order to investigate the association between autophagy-related proteins, beclin 1 and LC3, with prognostic value and clinical characteristics of ovarian cancer.


EVIDENCE ACQUISITION
PubMed, EMBASE and CNKI databases (up to August 2016) were searched for eligible studies using the following key words: ""beclin 1"", ""beclin-1"", ""Becn 1"", ""Becn-1"", ""Atg6"", ""LC3"", ""ovarian cancer"", ""ovarian carcinoma"", ""ovarian neoplasm"", ""ovarian tumor"", ""ovary cancer"", ""ovary carcinoma"", ""ovary neoplasm"", ""ovary tumor"". The random effects model was used to combine effect sizes. Higgins I2 value was used to examine heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the heterogeneity and the stability of the results. Egger's test and Harbord's test were used to examine publication bias.


EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS
Eight studies including a total of 872 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. The results showed expressions of both beclin 1 (OR=0.498, 95% CI: 0.298-0.832) and LC3 (OR=0.308, 95% CI: 0.142-0.668) were associated with FIGO stage (FIGO I/II versus FIGO III/IV). However, no association was found between the expression of beclin 1 and overall survival (HR=0.678, 95% CI: 0.434-1.058), age (OR=0.965, 95% CI: 0.473-1.967), lymph node metastasis (OR=0.517, 95% CI: 0.218-1.227), pathological classification (OR=0.895, 95% CI: 0.649-1.233) and differentiation (OR=0.571, 95% CI: 0.261-1.247). Similarly, no relationship was found between LC3 with age (OR=0.947, 95% CI: 0.399-2.248), pathological classification (OR=0.821, 95% CI: 0.410-1.644), and differentiation (OR=0.432, 95% CI: 0.118-1.580).


CONCLUSIONS
Autophagy-related proteins might be important markers of ovarian cancer progression. However, due to the limited number of original studies, more well-designed, large-scale, high-quality studies are needed, which provide new, valuable information for further investigation.",0

The eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE parameters Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm has been designed for the top-of-atmosphere reflectance measured by the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument on board Sentinel-3 to derive snow properties: snow grain size (SGS), snow particle shape (SPS) and specific surface area (SSA) under cloud-free conditions. This is the first part of the paper, to describe the retrieval method and the sensitivity study. Nine pre-defined SPSs (aggregate of 8 columns, droxtal, hollow bullet rosette, hollow column, plate, aggregate of 5 plates, aggregate of 10 plates, solid bullet rosette, column) are used to describe the snow optical properties. The optimal SGS and SPS are estimated iteratively utilizing a look-up-table (LUT) approach. The SSA is then calculated using another pre-calculated LUT for the retrieved SGS and SPS. The optical properties (e.g., phase function) of the ice crystals can reproduce the wavelength-dependent and angular-dependent snow reflectance features, compared to laboratory measurements. A comprehensive study to understand the impact of aerosols, SPS, ice crystal surface roughness, cloud contamination, instrument spectral response function, the snow habit mixture model and snow vertical inhomogeneity in the retrieval accuracy of snow properties has been performed based on SCIATRAN radiative transfer simulations. The main findings are (1) snow angular and spectral reflectance features can be described by the predefined ice crystal properties only when both SGS and SPS can be optimally and iteratively obtained; (2) the impact of ice crystal surface roughness on the retrieval results is minor; (3) SGS and SSA show an inverse linear relationship; (4) the retrieval of SSA assuming a non-convex particle shape, compared to a convex particle shape (e.g., sphere), shows larger retrieval results; (5) aerosol/cloud contamination due to unperfected atmospheric correction and cloud screening introduces underestimation of SGS, “inaccurate” SPS and overestimation of SSA; (6) the impact of the instrument spectral response function introduces an overestimation into retrieved SGS, introduces an underestimation into retrieved SSA and has no impact on retrieved SPS; and (7) the investigation, by taking an ice crystal particle size distribution and habit mixture into account, reveals that XBAER-retrieved SGS agrees better with the mean size, rather than with the mode size, for a given particle size distribution.

The present study investigated the prevalence, genetic characteristics, and antimicrobial resistance profile of Escherichia coli from surface water sources. Fifty-two water samples were analyzed by using a spread plate, a biochemical test, and multiplex polymerase chain reactions. E. coli was isolated from each of the 52 water samples. Of these isolates, 75% were noted to possess virulence genes. Approximately 54% of the isolates were characterized as follows: enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC, 10.26%), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC, 17.95%), verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC, 23.07%), and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC, 2.57%). Eighteen of the fifty-two isolates could not be characterized due to heterogeneity in banding. The disc diffusion method was used to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. The isolates were most resistant to ceftazidime, augmentin, and cefuroxime. Multidrug resistance was recorded in 48.1% of the isolates. In contrast, the isolates were most susceptible to ciprofloxacin (86.5%), nitrofurantoin (84.6%), and ofloxacin (75%). These results revealed a high diversity and widespread of E. coli in northern Ghana.

Following their individual trajectories from the late 1930s until the late 1940s, this essay investigates the social habitat and social interactions of these three men in the Dutch capital just before, during and directly after the Holocaust. The focus is on their emotional reactions to the accumulative restrictive orders in the course of the Holocaust and, more specifically, on the impact of the dramatic events on their feelings of belonging and on their perceptions of their community. Exploring the little-studied domain of emotions, this essay sheds light on their tactics to survive, their networks of rescue, their circles of identification and disidentification and their postwar response to the Holocaust. The three microhistories present significant differentiations and complications of our knowledge. They illuminate the strength of the ties with their prewar circles of identification, only to loosen in the phase of the deportations, and only in the case of Joop Voet. They also produce important counternarratives of the dominant narrative in literature of “double victimhood” of Dutch Jews in the afterwar period. Their dissociation from the postwar Jewish community of Amsterdam, a community of victims, should be related to their choice for political activism and public engagement.",0

This study identifies the factors which are liable to loan default in urban informal credit markets. A questionnaire survey was conducted among four hundred low-income people in Dhaka city who took loans from informal credit markets. A logistic regression was used to find out the factors which cause loan default in these markets. The results show that loan default is strongly related to interest rate, size of loan, loan diversion, and collateral of loan. In addition, multiple sources of income, borrower’s monthly income, education and age play important roles in this regard. The identification of the factors affecting loan default is expected to help the loan providers of both informal and formal credit markets to reduce default loans and establish discipline in financial markets.

 The Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development (ICC) was created to foster cooperation between pharmaceutical companies with antiviral drugs in clinical development so as to more rapidly develop therapies for people with AIDS. Recent activities, reported at the May 11, 1995 meeting, include an agreement by the participating companies to extend their collaboration into basic research to share developed animal models, share biologic data for drug resistance studies, exchange biochemical assays, and share data on compounds that failed in pre-clinical development. In addition, ICC-001 is the first study evaluating the effect of two separate three-drug combinations, AZT/ddC/Invirase and AZT/ddC/nevirapine compared to AZT/ddC, in 225 patients. The trial is fully enrolled although the number of female participants is low. ICC-002 is scheduled to begin enrolling June 12, 1995, to compare AZT/ddI/nevirapine and AZT/ddI/3TC to AZT/ddI, again in 225 patients. Also at the meeting, two new clinical trial designs were proposed. Jules Levin recommended that the collaborative run combination protease inhibitor studies, specifically of Merck's MK-639 and Roche's invirase (saquinavir). Bill Bahlman proposed that the ICC run open-label studies of a new three-drug combination in thirty patients every month in order to quickly discover more potent combination therapies. Finally, David Barry, M.D., of the Burroughs Wellcome Co. (and chair of the ICC's clinical trials subcommittee) proposed to establish an observational database that would gather data on every person with HIV under treatment by a physician.

A modified radioactive rose bengal test is described which permits obtaining simultaneously data about the pulmonary circulation time, cardioportal circulation time and liver cell function.
This test was applied to 15 normal subjects and 61 patients suffering from hepatosplenic bilharziasis of variable severity. The results obtained confirm the rather late appearance of liver cell dysfunction in bilharziasis. This began to be seen in patients with firm livers even in the absence of signs of portal hypertension. The incidence of hepatocellular affection increased markedly with the appearance of esophageal varices and/or ascites.
Furthermore, the suggested test was of great value in cases of hepatosplenic affection with an associated cardiac lesion.",0

The rich drama of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, for example, is well appreciated while in progress, but what most theatergoers remember about it afterward is, first and foremost, ""Et tu, Brute?"" Powerful moments like this overshadow other vital--albeit less quotable--features of the story. A similar dynamic obtains in the study of history. The sprawling violence of World War II tends to block out many of the stories hidden within the larger narrative of the conflict. Even momentous events, such as the 1940 Bases-for-Destroyers Deal in which Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill exchanged American warships for British-owned Western-Hemisphere bases, while recognized for their intrinsic importance, are folded into the broader tableau of Anglo-American diplomacy. Thus are some of its offshoots, some scarcely perceived, easily lost. For many the bases deal is usually (and correctly) seen as an important milestone in the gradual retreat of the British Empire and the expansion of the new American regime. However, it is equally important as a milestone in the struggle of Caribbean peoples to secure independence from both. Moreover, the precise reasons also touch upon the American mainland, in particular African people on the mainland. What historian David Reynolds labels wartime ""competitive co-operation"" between the United States and Britain opened up new opportunities for those fighting the long battle for Caribbean independence. These opportunities ultimately grew out of the black community of New York City, a community burgeoning with southern African American and West Indian transplants who now found themselves neighbors in the urban North. This in turn points to another important and overshadowed historical development. Just as the history of the Atlantic Alliance eclipses the full story of the Bases Deal, the ""New Negro"" Renaissance in Harlem in the 1920s similarly obscures the subsequent extent of transnational black activism in the diplomacy of Caribbean decolonization. The renaissance in Harlem was the fruit of the two parallel migrations that brought the black diaspora to New York City: African Americans from the southern United States, and West Indians from their home islands. At its apogee, fully one-quarter of Harlem's population was of West Indian origin, a diverse diasporan community that might be called the ""Harlem nexus."" The designation is meant more figuratively than literally; outlying communities then growing from Brooklyn to New Jersey, not to mention organizations such as the NAACP located elsewhere in the city, meant that black New York did not end at 110th Street. Yet that neighborhood provided a spiritual home for important cultural and political developments, even if some participants in them ""may have"" resided outside Harlem proper. The importance of this transnational connection did not end with the renaissance; flying well under the geopolitical radar, it would continue to have an important impact into the 1940s and beyond. A full understanding of this impact requires transcending conventional historiographical categories in order to illuminate points of contact between them. Much of the literature on U.S. African American urban history tends to focus on localized factors--regional institutions, city geography, economic and cultural particularities--and at most on select, narrowly defined national issues. (1) The literature on diplomatic history, on the other hand, traditionally leans in the other direction--favoring ""macro"" over ""micro,"" and risking insufficient attention to subglobal actors. Emerging scholarly trends, however, challenge the habits and limits of both literatures. In the last two decades, historians of U.S. foreign relations have fruitfully examined the role of race in American diplomacy. (2) Beyond that subfield alone, the historical profession has begun the ""transnational turn,"" a movement toward new modes of historical analysis that can reap undiscovered insights and connections from familiar narratives. …",0

The study was performed on a sample of 200 medium-sized industrial Spanish firms, employing Structural Equations Modelling methodology. Our findings suggest that, under the EFQM Model, the influence of both leadership and strategy on people allows organisations to improve their performance. Moreover, a strategic approach helps to enhance the contribution of personnel in the results of the company. It has not been found in prior literature any joint framework linking leadership, strategy, personnel, strategic human resource management and performance in QM organisations. This study helps managers to identify what types of strategy and leadership can be most effective in improving the company's results. At the same time, it is a stimulus for personnel directors who defend a strategic approach to the human resources function in their companies.",0

Building auto-focusing systems for the spectrographs is important due to the popularity of instruments. The system enables the optical system to automatically compensate changes in accordance to external variables, such as temperature, timidity, to ensure the spectrum collected more reliably. Image-based algorithm is utilized to calculate the departure of CCD plane from optical focal plane. The calculation also aids to regulation of the system. The defocus value is transformed to the controlling computer of each spectrograph. A driving step-motor performs refocusing function by moving the fiber slit unit to its right position.",0

By the introduction of developmental care neonatal nurses and doctors commenced to regard the preterm patient as an autonomous person with consciousness although at a minimal level. The thalamocortical connections from the sense organs are established from about the 23rd gestational week, indicating that the neuronal global workspace can function (see ref1). From about 25 weeks cortical responses in the somatosensory area have been recorded by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and facial expressions similar to adults sustaining pain have been observed in preterm infants after 25 weeks The preterm infant is aware of its body, itself and to some extent of the outside world. It recognises faces, vowels and smells it has been exposed to. Recent NIRS studies have shown that the preterm brain reacts differently to female versus male voices.2 It expresses emotions like joy. By functional MR it has been demonstrated that there is a spontaneous resting activity encompassing the somatosensory, auditory and visual cortex, although there is less activity in association area and the prefrontal cortex as compared with adults. There is an incomplete default mode network which is assumed to be related to consciousness.3 References Lagercrantz H, Hanson, M., Ment, L., Rodeck, C. (Eds) The Newborn Brain 2nd ed.

In B. americanus, the forebrain and medial parts of the inferior colliculi are not necessary for releasing (i.e. unclasping) behavior. Small lesions at the lateral edge of the anterio-dorsal nucleus of the inferior colliculi abolish releasing. After removal of the clasp-inhibition mechanisms of the trigemino-isthmic tegmentum, toads show strong clasping (foreleg adduction) and strong releasing (hindleg kicking) movements simultaneously. This suggests that releasing is a distinct behavior pattern, rather than merely an inhibition of clasping Normal releasing can be evoked in B. americanus after complete bilateral labyrinthectomy, and the presence of a nearby, release-calling male does not evoke releasing by a clasping male. Therefore, it must be mainly the tactile effects, rather than the auditory or vestibular effects, of the release signals that evoke releasing. The effects of section of the dorsal roots of various spinal nerves in B. americanus confirm that the foreleg is the most important area for reception of the tactile stimuli evoking clasping and releasing. Gross lesions of the forefoot and sections of various nerves to the forefoot show that receptors involved in eliciting these behaviors are widely distributed in this area. The forefoot sensory field of the deep radial nerve is especially involved in clasping.",0

To study the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in diabetic nephropathy of Kkay mice with hyperhomocysteinemia.


METHODS
Sixteen Kkay mice were divided into two groups with 8 in each:diabetes group (KA) and methionine-diet group (KB). C57BL/6 mice were used as normal control (C57). Four months after being treated with two different diets, the mice were sacrificed and serum homocysteine (Hcy) was assayed with fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Renal pathological change was examined with periodic acid Schiff (PAS). The expression of MMP-9 protein and mRNA was detected with immunohistochemical staining and reverse transcriptase-PCR respectively.


RESULTS
It was shown that induction of hyperhomocysteinemia in Kkay mice (KB) with a diet enriched in methionine aggravated diabetic nephropathy as compared with the KA group (P < 0.05). The expression of MMP-9 protein and mRNA in KB group was also enhanced and the mean positive area of MMP-9 in KB group was higher than that in KA group (15.90% vs 11.14%, P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
The increased level of Hcy could worsen the nephropathy; this may be related to a higher expression of MMP-9.",0

We used three different approaches for the patterning of the alumina we would like to use in integrated humidity sensors in the future. The first was the wet etching of the completed alumina covering the entire wafer surface with conventional photolithography. The second method was based on selective anodization using photoresist as barrier layer to prevent the formation of alumina from aluminum where it is not necessary. In the third case we used a chemically resistant and conductive layer below the pre-patterned Al “islands” for proper electrical connection needed during anodization. The results of the different methods were compared and optimal parameters were given where it was possible.,0

Evidence of entrainment in adults is robust, yet research regarding its development in children is sparse. Here, we investigate the emergence of entrainment skills in typically developing children. Method Data were collected from a total of 50 typically developing children between the ages of 5 and 14 years. Children participated in a quasiconversational paradigm with a virtual interlocutor. Speech rate of the interlocutor was digitally manipulated to produce fast and slow speech rate conditions. Results Data from the fast and slow conditions were compared using linear mixed models. Results indicated that children, regardless of age, did not alter their speech to match the rate of the virtual interlocutor. Conclusions Findings suggest that entrainment in children may not be as robust as entrainment in adults and therefore not adequately captured with the current experimental paradigm.

Previous NGS assays separately treat DNA and/or RNA, and are costly and produce limited information. Here we present a concurrent assay simultaneously converting both RNA and DNA templates in a single-tube format to streamline variant detection process. Methods: We developed a high-throughput targeted resequencing assay utilizing both DNA and RNA templates for mutation and fusion detection, and applied to a cohort of over 1000 lung tumor samples. Total nucleic acids from tissue samples were processed in a single-tube format throughout, and post-assay data analysis split RNA and DNA signals for corresponding variant calling. Sensitivity and specificity were sufficient for tissue samples. Results: In addition to common EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations and ALK, ROS1, RET fusions and MET Exon 14 skipping, we also identified rare HLA-DRB1---MET and MSN---NTRK2 fusions. We found that MET exon 14 skipping was abundant, and that EGFR T790M is more associated with Exon 19 deletion than with L858R. We also found baseline mutation frequency for FFPE samples at 4-5%. Conclusions: Overall, this method is robust and convenient for clinical molecular diagnosis for tissue samples where variant types are diverse and time and budgets are constrained. Extreme caution is suggested for making positive calls below 5% MAF.",0

As a rule, these patients have unbalanced ventricles. However, there have been no studies describing the results of single-ventricle palliation in these children. Methods: All children who underwent surgery with a diagnosis of atrioventricular septal defect and transposition of the great arteries were included in the study. Data were obtained from medical records. Results: A total of 38 patients with atrioventricular septal defect and transposition of the great arteries underwent single-ventricle palliation at the study institution between 1971 and 2016. The mean follow-up was 12.4 years (median: 14.6 years, range 2–43.3 years). Most children had unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect (94.7%, 36/38). Survival was 67.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 50.0–80.2%) at 10 years and 57.8% (95% CI: 38.0–73.4%) at 20 years. By 10 years, 58.6% (95% CI: 40.8–72.7%) had progressed to Fontan completion, while 32.5% (95% CI: 18.2–47.6%) had died. In patients achieving Fontan completion, 20-year event-free survival was 73.3% (95% CI: 34.8–91.3%), while 5.0% (95% CI: 0.4–20.5%) had undergone cardiac transplantation and 21.7% (95% CI: 3.2–50.8%) had undergone takedown of the Fontan circulation. Freedom from atrioventricular valve surgery was 57.0% (95% CI: 37.2–72.7%) at 10 and 20 years. Conclusions: The association of atrioventricular septal defect and transposition of the great arteries is very rare, and most of these children have unbalanced ventricles.

A year later, deepening those gaps and slowing changes, the pandemic appeared as a pause in institutional redefinitions. As effects of both crises, today the country is experiencing an exponential increase in land seizures, prosecution and discrediting of the political system, changes in the traditional political axes, increase in populism and debates on the development model to be adopted, and, as a cross-cutting issue, profound questions to the traditional forms of social participation in a democratic system. It is precisely in this last aspect that the paradox offered by Chilean institutions in terms of social participation is noticed. With a robust and multi-channel design of participation spaces, the institutionality presents at the same time, high rates of disaffection in traditional systems but a sustained increase in social up-heaval and the effective incidence of activist groups.

This qualitative study examined the perceived impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the lives and work experiences of service providers in the homeless service, supportive housing, and harm reduction sectors in Canada. Further analyses were conducted to identify the occupational values that were represented in the work‐related changes experienced by providers. A stratified purposive sample of 40 participants (30 direct service providers and 10 providers in leadership roles) were drawn from a pan‐Canadian study of the mental health of service providers working with individuals experiencing homelessness. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify five themes of the work‐related changes experienced by service providers during the pandemic: [1] “Everything was changing every day”: Work role and responsibility instability; [2] “How on Earth do we do our job?”: Challenges to working relationships with service users; [3] “It used to be a social environment”: Transitions to impersonal and isolating workspaces; [4] “It all comes down the chute”: Lack of organisational support and hierarchical conflict; and [5] “We've been supported as well as we could have”: Positive organisational support and communication. The findings underscored how many of the occupational changes during the pandemic did not align with service providers' occupational values for collaboration, control, effective and safe service provision, and the importance of human relationships, among other values. As pre‐existing sectoral problems were exacerbated by the pandemic, recovery efforts need to address these long‐standing issues in ways that are aligned with service providers' values. Future research is warranted on how organisational approaches can promote supportive workplaces for service providers and improve outcomes for individuals experiencing homelessness.",0

Service providers working with people experiencing homelessness can be directly and indirectly exposed to trauma and other chronic stressors in their work. The types of individuals that are most at-risk of problematic outcomes from traumatic event exposure are unknown.


AIM
This study examined exposure to and effects of workplace traumas and stressors among service providers working with people experiencing homelessness in Canada.


METHODS
A cross-sectional survey was completed by 701 direct service providers working in the homeless service, supportive housing, and harm reduction sectors. Descriptive statistics, hierarchical multiple regression, and double moderation models were used in the analysis.


RESULTS
Employment in homeless service settings, service provision to single adults, and more time in direct contact with service users were each positively associated with the frequency of exposure to critical events and chronic stressors. Younger age, lived experience of behavioural health problems, more frequent exposure to chronic stressors, and less social support from coworkers were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress and general psychological distress. Emotional support from supervision moderated the relationship between direct exposure to workplace critical events and post-traumatic stress.


CONCLUSIONS
More trauma-informed psychosocial supports tailored to the needs of direct service providers working with people experiencing homelessness are needed.",0

Purpose
This study aims to examine the emotional and cognitive responses of frontline homelessness service support staff to the highly insecure attachment styles (AS) exhibited by people experiencing multiple exclusion homelessness (MEH), that is, a combination of homelessness and other forms of deep social exclusion.


Design/methodology/approach
Focus groups were conducted with frontline staff (N = 19) in four homelessness support services in Scotland. Hypothetical case vignettes depicting four insecure AS (enmeshed, fearful, withdrawn and angry-dismissive) were used to facilitate discussions. Data is analysed thematically.


Findings
Service users with AS characterised by high anxiety (enmeshed or fearful) often evoked feelings of compassion in staff. Their openness to accepting help led to more effective interactions between staff and service users. However, the high ambivalence and at times overdependence associated with these AS placed staff at risk of study-related stress and exhaustion. Avoidant service users (withdrawn or angry-dismissive) evoked feelings of frustration in staff. Their high need for self-reliance and defensive attitudes were experienced as hostile and dismissing. This often led to job dissatisfaction and acted as a barrier to staff engagement, leaving this group more likely to “fall through the net” of support.


Originality/value
Existing literature describes challenges that support staff encounter when attempting to engage with people experiencing MEH, but provides little insight into the causes or consequences of “difficult” interactions. This study suggests that an attachment-informed approach to care can promote more constructive engagement between staff and service users in the homelessness sector.

Purpose To evaluate whether reinforcing CVAD care bundles by using a regular direct feedback system could reduce such complications in children. Methods The intervention in this retrospective interrupted time-series study was initiated in January 2019. The study was divided into the preintervention (October–December 2018), 3-month postintervention (January–March 2019), and 6-month postintervention (April–June 2019) phases. Risk difference and Poisson regression analyses were used to illustrate the effectiveness of the intervention. Results The hospital-wide central line-related bloodstream infection rate decreased from 10.0/1,000 catheter-days to 4.5/1,000 catheter-days at 3-month postintervention (P=0.39) and to 1.4/1,000 catheter-days at 6-month postintervention (P=0.047). The central line occlusion rate significantly decreased from 30% to 12.8% (P=0.04) and 8.3% (P=0.002) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Approximately 7% of CVADs became dislodged during the preintervention phase versus 8.5% (P=0.364) and 3.3% (P=0.378) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Conclusion Reinforcing CVAD care bundles with direct feedback could significantly decrease CVAD-associated complications in terms of infection at 6-month postintervention, and occlusion at 3- and 6-month postintervention. Thus, reinforcement and regular direct feedback might improve care quality in children with CVADs.",0

Vascular access is essential in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether critically ill children with obesity are more likely to undergo vascular device insertion (excluding peripheral IV catheters) and develop related complications. Design: Multi-institutional retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Ninety-four U.S. PICUs included in the Virtual Pediatric Systems, LLC database. Patients: 120,272 unique patients 2 to less than 18 years old admitted between January 2009 and December 2014. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Patients were categorized into normal weight, overweight, and obese (class 1, 2, or 3); underweight patients were excluded. We used mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression to test body mass index category as an independent predictor of vascular device placement and associated complications, adjusted for age, sex, severity of illness, primary diagnosis, presence of a complex chronic condition, and admission related to trauma or surgery. A total of 73,964 devices were placed in 45,409 patients (37.8% of the total cohort received a vascular device). Most device types placed differed significantly by weight status. Subjects with class 3 obesity were less likely (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.81) to undergo placement of any device compared with normal weight patients. Patients with all classes of obesity were more likely to undergo placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter, with the strongest association in those with class 2 obesity (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14–1.40). Class 1 and class 3 obesity were independent risk factors for developing a complication, with odds ratio of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.11–1.53) and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.07–1.99), respectively. Conclusions: Severe obesity is associated with decreased overall likelihood of placement of a vascular access device but increased likelihood of peripherally inserted central catheter placement and of device-related complications.",0

Dental practice is eminently invasive and involves close and routine contact with secretions; as such, it is potentially prone to the occurrence of adverse events. Various patient safety studies have been developed in the last two decades, but mostly in the hospital setting due to the organizational complexity, severity of the cases, and diversity and specificity of the procedures. The objective was to identify and explore studies on patient safety in Dentistry. An integrative literature review was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus via Portal Capes, and the Regional Portal of the Virtual Health Library, using the terms patient safety and dentistry in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, starting in 2000. The research cycle in patient safety was used, as proposed by the World Health Organization to classify studies. We analyzed 91 articles. The most common adverse events were allergies, infections, diagnostic delay or failure, and technical error. Measures to mitigate the problem highlight the need to improve communications, encourage reporting, and search for tools to assist the management of care. The authors found a lack of studies on implementation and assessment of the impact of proposals for improvement. Dentistry has made progress in patient safety but still needs to transpose the results into practice, where efforts are crucial to prevent adverse events.",0

Ninety women were evaluated, of whom 57 were confirmed as having endometriosis. Lactoferrin was measured by ELISA, transferrin, ferritin and iron on a Cobas 8000 analyser. Lactoferrin and transferrin in peritoneal fluid were lower compared to plasma, in contrast to ferritin and iron. In plasma, lactoferrin showeds associations with iron and transferrin in endometriosis and with ferritin in the group without endometriosis. Lactoferrin in peritoneal fluid correlated with lactoferrin, iron and transferrin of plasma in patients without endometriosis. The ratio of lactoferrin concentration in peritoneal fluid to plasma differentiated stage I versus IV of endometriosis and was negatively correlated with the iron ratio in patients without endometriosis. The ferritin ratio differentiated women with and without endometriosis. The very high ferritin ratios, especially in advanced stages of endometriosis, suggest the protective involvement of this protein in peritoneal fluid and the loss of this role by lactoferrin.

Therefore, it is imperative to identify reliable, non-invasive biomarkers of the disease. The aim of this study was to analyse the concentrations of fibronectin and type IV collagen in peritoneal fluid and plasma to assess their role as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of endometriosis. Fibronectin and collagen IV protein levels were assessed by surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) biosensors with the usage of monoclonal antibodies. All patients enrolled in the study were referred for laparoscopy for the diagnosis of infertility or chronic pelvic pain (n = 84). The study group included patients with endometriosis confirmed during surgery (n = 49). The concentration of fibronectin in the plasma (329.3 ± 98.5 mg/L) and peritoneal fluid (26.8 ± 11.1 μg/L) in women with endometriosis was significantly higher than in the control group (251.2 ± 84.0 mg/L, 7.0 ± 5.9 μg/L). Fibronectin levels were independent of endometriosis stage (p = 0.874, p = 0.469). No significant differences were observed in collagen IV levels (p = 0.385, p = 0.465). The presence of elevated levels of fibronectin may indicate abnormalities in cell–ECM signalling during the course of endometriosis, and may be a potential biomarker for early detection.",0

While laparoscopic surgery is the recommend gold standard in diagnosis of endometriosis, transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is able to assist surgeons in the planning and management of patients, especially when there is limited visualisation in the posterior compartment. Uterosacral ligaments (USL) are located in the posterior compartment and are one of the first and most common places that endometriosis deposits, The International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) group consensus, which are the current guidelines for DE imaging, recommends a thorough ultrasound assessment to identify endometriotic disease. This includes an assessment of anatomic structures in the posterior compartment including the USLs. However, IDEA does not explicitly articulate specifics of USL imaging and measurements on ultrasound. The primary aim of this review is to determine is to identify ultrasound techniques and characteristics of USLs in the diagnosis of deep infiltrative endometriosis (DE). The secondary aim is to describe and summarise these findings into normal and pathological findings. A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A population, interventions, comparator, and outcome framework was used to define a search strategy. Articles were screened using Covidence review management system, and data was extracted by two authors using a standardised and piolet-tested form. Quality assessment was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Medline, Embase and Scopus and Google Scholar were searched yielding 250 articles, with 22 being included in the review. Analysis of the data demonstrated inconsistent reporting of ultrasound techniques and characteristics of USLs. Most (20/22) papers described abnormal criteria of USLs, only 5/22 papers determined what the normal USL appearance is or what techniques (11/22) were applied. Even though reporting was heterogeneous, there was a high level of tertiary centre participation with gynaecological experienced operators, therefore was a high level of agreement. Through review of the current literature, this study has investigated ultrasound techniques and characteristics of USLs for the diagnosis of DE. All papers included in this review reported presence of pathological sonographic findings of the USLs when DE was presented therefore it is recommended that USL examination become a part of TVS exams when DE is clinically suspected. This study also demonstrated that there was lack of data and no agreement when it comes to measuring USLs with DE. Even so, the current evidence demonstrates that scanning the USLs, and locating, identifying, and describing USL thickening and endometriotic nodules in the various locations using the described techniques and characteristics in this review has clinical value in early diagnosis.",0

In this study, done over an 8-year period, several histological features were analysed including an attempt to grade the severity of endometriosis histologically based on the number of foci per low power field. The components in each focus, the phasing of the glands and stroma, the type of glands (endometrial type or undifferentiated type), and stromal features were all analysed. This study attempts to histologically grade endometriosis while relating it to the clinical manifestations and anatomical location. Eighty cases of endometriosis were included. Most common clinical presentation was cyclical pain (n = 62) and the most common anatomical location was adnexa (n = 50). Histologically, severe endometriosis (>3 foci) was seen in 37 cases. The components were mixed in 68 cases. Well-differentiated glandular pattern was typical (n = 54), while 6 cases had undifferentiated. Proliferative phase was seen in 38 cases. Fibrosis and inflammation were present in 29 and 42 cases, respectively. Significant vascular proliferation and plasma cell infiltrate was noted (n = 35). The severe grade was significantly associated with fibrosis (p = 0.03) and inflammation (p = 0.014). Endometriotic foci, unlike eutopic endometrium, shows significant plasma cell infiltrate and vascular proliferation.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Endometriosis, a chronic inflammatory condition in reproductive age group women. The currently used clinical staging and grading systems show poor correlation with patient symptoms and treatment outcomes. Endometriosis with classical histopathological features pose no diagnostic difficulty, however, there is poor concordance with histopathology. Atypical endometriosis is proposed as potential precursor for endometriosis related neoplasms, however, it remains as a controversial entity.What do the results of this study add? The study identifies the uncommon histological patterns which may be encountered in biopsy samples from clinically identified endometriotic lesions. The recognition of these patterns will reduce clinico-pathological discrepancies. In keeping with the other grading systems, attempts at histological grading did not show any correlation with location or patient symptoms. Atypical features were seen only in two cases and was likely to be reactive in nature.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Undifferentiated glandular pattern is often a under-recognized histological pattern. Histological grading of severity was a novel attempt to correlate with clinical parameters. Significant plasma cell infiltrate and vascular proliferation in endometriotic foci, underscores the quest for novel therapeutic targets. This study suggests that the use of non-invasive diagnostic methods like fibroscan/inflammatory markers to clinically identify severe disease should be investigated further.",0

There is emerging evidence that biological compounds found in garlic (Allium sativum) may be effective for attenuating endometrial pain. Suggested mechanisms for efficacy include modulation of inflammation and potent antioxidant effects. Aged-garlic-extract (AGE) is a centuries old process describing ethanolic extracts of garlic bulbs for 12–20 months. The AGE formulation realised contains a complex array of stabilised biologics with significant immunomodulatory effects relevant to inflammatory conditions.

The material for genetic testing for the expression of lncRNA genes were tissue slices embedded in paraffin blocks from patients with endometriosis (n = 100) and the control group (n = 100). Gene expression was determined by the RT-PCR technique. The expression of the H19 gene in endometriosis patients was statistically significantly lower than in the control group. A statistically significant association was found between H19 gene expression in relation to The Revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification of endometriosis (rASRM) in the group of patients with endometriosis. Research suggests that H19 expression plays an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.",0

The purpose of this work is to determine to what extent a history of endometriosis is a risk factor for ovarian cancer in a Spanish population. Methods: A retrospective case–control study was conducted using de-identified data from the Spanish National Health System’s “Primary Care Clinical Database” and “Hospital Minimum Basic Data Set” for the period 2013–2017. Multiple logistics regression analysis was conducted to determine associations between ovarian cancer and endometriosis controlled by sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities. Results: Data from 608,980 women were analyzed, with 4505 presenting ovarian cancer. Endometriosis patients were shown to have a 2.66-fold increased risk of ovarian cancer when compared to those who did not have endometriosis by controlling age and other relevant comorbidities. Conclusions: This case–control study based on clinical administrative data has found that a history of endometriosis is independently associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. More research is needed to determine if a history of endometriosis affects survival results in ovarian cancer patients.",0

Clinical examination, transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are significant preoperative non-invasive diagnosis procedures for the accurate assessment of endometriosis. Although TVS is used as the primary line for diagnosis, MRI is commonly utilized to achieve a better anatomical overview of the entire pelvic organs. The aim of this systematic review article is to thoroughly summarize the research on various endometriosis diagnosis methods that are less invasive. (2) Methods: To find relevant studies, we examined electronic databases, such as MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, choosing 70 papers as references. (3) Results: The findings indicate that various approaches can contribute to diagnosis in different ways, depending on the type of endometriosis. For patients suspected of having deep pelvic endometriosis, transvaginal sonography should be the first line of diagnosis. Endometriosis cysts are better diagnosed with TVS, whereas torus, uterosacral ligaments, intestine, and bladder endometriosis lesions are best diagnosed using MRI. When it comes to detecting intestine or rectal nodules, as well as rectovaginal septum nodules, MRI should be the imaging tool of choice. (4) Conclusions: When diagnosing DE (deep infiltrative endometriosis), the examiner’s experience is the most important criterion to consider. In the diagnosis of endometriosis, expert-guided TVS is more accurate than routine pelvic ultrasound, especially in the deep infiltrative form. For optimal treatment and surgical planning, accurate preoperative deep infiltrative endometriosis diagnosis is essential, especially because it requires a multidisciplinary approach.",0

Symptoms of severe pelvic pain, infertility, fatigue, and abnormal menstruation can cause significant negative effects on an individual’s physical and mental health, including interactions with their family, friends, and health care providers. Stigma associated with endometriosis has been under-studied and is rarely discussed in current literature. Herein, this paper aims to provide a brief overview of published literature to explore and establish the plausibility of stigma as a driver of suboptimal psychosocial well-being and diagnostic delay among individuals living with endometriosis. We present the clinical characteristics and physical and mental health consequences associated with endometriosis, highlight several theoretical constructs of stigma, and review the limited studies documenting women’s lived experiences of endometriosis-related stigma. To mitigate harmful effects of this phenomenon, we recommend increasing efforts to assess the prevalence of and to characterize endometriosis-related stigma, implementing awareness campaigns, and developing interventions that combat the multidimensional negative effects of stigma on timely care, treatment, and quality of life for individuals living with endometriosis.",0

However, the ability to understand the effectiveness of such events at influencing conservation behavior is confounded by the likelihood that attendees are already interested in conservation and may already be adopters. Understanding characteristics of events that draw non-adopters can aid in designing events and messaging that are better able to reach beyond those already interested in conservation. Methods For this study, we interviewed 101 operators of private agricultural lands in Maryland, USA, and used descriptive statistics and qualitative comparative analysis to investigate differences between the kinds of outreach events that adopters and non-adopters attended. Results Our results suggested that non-adopters, as compared to adopters, attended events that provided production-relevant information and were logistically easy to attend. Further, non-adopters were more selective when reading advertisements, generally preferring simplicity. Future research and outreach can build on these findings by experimentally testing the effectiveness of messages that are simple and relevant to farmers’ production priorities.",0

Utilizing survey data from the Northern Great Plains, this paper provides a better understanding of farmers’ perceptions on water quality issues in their local areas. Excessive algal bloom and aquatic plants were among producers’ top water quality concerns in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Fertilizers/pesticides were perceived as either not a problem (28.7%) or a slight problem (43.7%) when it comes to the water pollution sources. While only 17.2% of the respondents indicated agreement upon paying taxes to help protect the local water quality, 43.5% agreed to implement conservation practices (CPs) at some cost, and 70.1% agreed to implement CPs at no direct cost to farmers to improve water quality. This paper examined the factors associated with the adoption of cover crops and buffer strips. We found that producers’ adoption decisions of cover crops largely hinged on farm characteristics and management variables, such as land ownership, farm size, livestock ownership, and adoption status of other farm management practices, while water quality information and producer perceptions affected the adoption decisions of both cover crops and buffer strips. To further promote CP adoption and reduce water pollution, our results highlighted the importance of both monetary incentives and outreach efforts that disseminate information on water pollution status and pollution sources, as well as technical support on CPs suitable for the farm.",0

 Experimental findings on rotational grazing (RG) trials have generally differed from producer observations of RG outcomes on commercial scale ranches. Factors such as small plot size, short duration trials and relatively rigid grazing management that lacks responsiveness to the dynamic and complex social-ecological systems in grazing trials could all contribute to this disparity in outcomes. These differences call for a better understanding of producer perceptions of RG benefits. To fill this knowledge gap, we surveyed 4500 producers from the Northern and Southern Great Plains of the USA. Among the 875 respondents, 40.5% reported that they used continuous grazing (CG), 52.7% implemented RG management in an extensive manner, while 6.8% adopted management intensive grazing. Compared with CG users, adopters of RG in its extensive and intensive form reported an average annual increase of grazing season by 7.6 and 39.3 days, respectively. When controlling for producer demographics, ranch management goals and other rancher characteristics, we found soil and climate heterogeneity significantly affected the perceived relative benefits of RG vs CG strategies. Therefore, instead of focusing on whether RG outperforms CG per se, future research could focus on comparison of RG benefits under different management intensity levels and identifying soil and climate conditions where RG benefits are more noticeable.",0

The purpose of this article was to systematically map the scientific literature on environmental, economic and social sustainability at farm-level beef and lamb meat production to identify knowledge gaps and to point to important future actions and areas of research. Papers published January 2000–August 2020 with a geographical origin in Europe, Northern America, and Australia-New Zealand were included. The systematic literature search resulted in a total of 1355 hits; however, after removing papers which were considered out of the scope of the study, and duplicate papers, only 22 and 11 papers related to beef and sheep farming, respectively were retained for further analysis. Of these, only 11 in total included all three sustainability dimensions. Several papers only mentioned one or two of the sustainability dimensions or put them in relation to that/those main dimension covered, thus limiting the extent to which possible synergies or tradeoffs between different sustainability aspects actually can be studied. This indicates a need for a more comprehensive approach when studying farm-level sustainability. Future research would benefit from a more holistic approach and include all dimensions of sustainability within the same study. Further, focus should also be on how to measure and assess sustainability aspects in a standardized way.",0

The upper bound for the optimisation problem considered is first determined by ignoring some constraints. Thereafter, a genetic algorithm (GA) is addressed to resolve the mixed-integer non-linear programming problem involved. To accommodate this joint consideration, each chromosome in the proposed GA is divided into an integer string for relay selection, and two real number strings for bandwidth allocation and power distribution. In addition, new crossover and mutation operations are employed for this new type of chromosomes. To alleviate the complexity overhead, a low-complexity two-stage implementation is also addressed. Conducted simulations show that both of the proposed GA and the two-stage implementation can attain close performance as the upper bound and outperform some representative previous works. The two-stage implementation is in particular appealing by exhibiting negligible performance degradation with reduced computations.",0

Recently, an increasing amount of attempts to use gamification for triggering such behavioural changes can be observed. However, little is known about the actual impact of using game elements. This contribution describes a concept for systematically analysing the group-specific effects of different game mechanics on mobility decision processes (e.g. mode and route choice). Based on theoretical findings concerning player types and mobility styles we developed a framework for identifying effective game mechanics motivating users to explore mobility alternatives and take more informed and more sustainable mode or route choice decisions. The results will form the basis for implementing game mechanics in mobility information services motivating users to explore unfamiliar but more sustainable mobility options.",0

To unravel the regulation of this network upon glucose perturbation, several metabolic models have been developed for the microorganism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These dynamic representations have focused on glycolysis and answered multiple research questions, but no commonly applicable model has been presented. This review systematically evaluates the literature to describe the current advances, limitations, and opportunities. Different kinetic models have unraveled key kinetic glycolytic mechanisms. Nevertheless, some uncertainties regarding model topology and parameter values still limit the application to specific cases. Progressive improvements in experimental measurement technologies as well as advances in computational tools create new opportunities to further extend the model scale. Notably, models need to be made more complex to consider the multiple layers of glycolytic regulation and external physiological variables regulating the bioprocess, opening new possibilities for extrapolation and validation. Finally, the onset of new data representative of individual cells will cause these models to evolve from depicting an average cell in an industrial fermenter, to characterizing the heterogeneity of the population, opening new and unseen possibilities for industrial fermentation improvement.",0

Moreover, the perturbation of the kinetic parameters are correlated with upregulation of the system by cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors, including mutations and the environment changes. Here, we aim at using well-established models of biological pathways to identify parameter values and point their potential perturbation/deviation. We present our population-based optimization framework that is able to identify kinetic parameters in the dynamic model based on only input and output data (i.e., timecourses of selected metabolites).

The results showed that acids at moderate concentrations can stimulate the glycolytic flux, while higher levels of acid slow down the glycolytic flux for both aerobically and anaerobically grown yeast cells. In particular, the flux distribution between respiratory and fermentative growth was adjusted to achieve an optimal ATP generation to allow a maintained energy level as high as it is in nonstressed cells grown exponentially on glucose under aerobic conditions. In addition, yeast cells exposed to acids suffered from severe reactive oxygen species stress and depletion of reduced glutathione commensurate with exhaustion of the total glutathione pool. Furthermore, a higher cellular trehalose content was observed as compared to control cultivations, and this trehalose probably acts to enhance a number of stress tolerances of the yeast.",0

Fish genotoxicity biomarkers are vital to identify and complement chemical parameters for determining environmental risk of adverse effects. Therefore, it was of interest to examine the eco-genotoxicity attributed to water pollution over different stream sections of Brazilian rivers by using Cichlasoma paranaense (Teleostei: Cichlidae), a neotropical freshwater cichlid ﬁsh, as a biological model. Chemical analysis of water and sediments collected from different Brazilian rivers sites demonstrated contamination by metals. Cichlasoma paranaense were collected at a reference location (a permanent water preservation area), maintained in the lab under standard conditions (controlled temperature, lighting, daily feeding, and constant aeration) and exposed to environmental samples of water and sediments. Subsequently, micronucleus (MN) and nuclear abnormalities (NA) frequencies were assessed in erythrocytes obtained from the caudal and gill regions. The highest concentrations of Cu were found in samples from river sites with forest fragmentation attributed to intensive agriculture practices. Similarly, exposure of fish to samples from agricultural areas induced significantly higher number of genotoxic effects. There was no marked difference between the tissues (tail and gill) regarding the observed frequencies of MN and NA. Thus C. paranaense fish served as a reliable model for detecting genotoxic effects, especially when water samples were collected near the discharge of agrochemicals. Evidence indicates that this method be considered for other global river sites which are also exposed to agrochemicals discharges containing Cu.",0

Environmental pollution is one of its drivers, including contamination of wildlife by chemicals emitted into the air, soil, and water. Chemicals released into the environment, even at low concentrations, may pose a negative effect on organisms. These chemicals might modify the synthesis, metabolism, and mode of action of hormones. This can lead to failures in reproduction, growth, and development of organisms potentially impacting their fitness. In this review, we focused on assessing the current knowledge on concentrations and possible effects of endocrine disruptor chemicals (metals, persistent organic pollutants, and others) in studies performed in South America, with findings at reproductive and thyroid levels. Our literature search revealed that most studies have focused on measuring the concentrations of compounds that act as endocrine disruptors in animals at the systemic level. However, few studies have evaluated the effects at a reproductive level, while information at thyroid disorders is scarce. Most studies have been conducted in fish by researchers from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. Comparison of results across studies is difficult due to the lack of standardization of units in the reported data. Future studies should prioritize research on emergent contaminants, evaluate effects on native species and the use of current available methods such as the OMICs. Additionally, there is a primary focus on organisms related to aquatic environments, and those inhabiting terrestrial environments are scarce or nonexistent. Finally, we highlight a lack of funding at a national level in the reviewed topic that may influence the observed low scientific productivity in several countries, which is often negatively associated with their percentage of protected areas.",0

N‐terminal microsequencing revealed sequence identity with a hypothetical polypeptide encoded by the yeast YGL037C open reading frame sharing 30% sequence identity with Escherichia coli pyrazinamidase/nicotinamidase. A yeast strain in which the NAMase gene, hereafter named PNC1, was deleted shows a decreased intracellular NAD+ concentration, consistent with the loss of NAMase activity in the null mutant. In wild‐type strains, NAMase activity is stimulated during the stationary phase of growth, by various hyperosmotic shocks or by ethanol treatment. Using a PPNC1::lacZ gene fusion, we have shown that this stimulation of NAMase activity results from increased levels of the protein and requires stress response elements in the 5′ non‐coding region of PNC1. These results suggest that NAMase helps yeast cells to adapt to various stress conditions and nutrient depletion, most likely via the activation of NAD‐dependent biological processes.

Aims The effects of dietary crude protein (CP) and phytonutrient mixture (PM) on growth performance and physiological responses were evaluated in broilers under circular heat stress (HS). Methods In total, 420 1-day-old broiler chickens were randomly distributed to seven treatments in a factorial arrangement (3 × 2), with three levels of CP (normal, medium (95% of the normal CP content) and low (90% of the normal CP content)) and with or without the addition of PM (mixture of 5 mg/kg carvacrol, 3 mg/kg cinnamaldehyde, and 2 mg/kg capsicum oleoresin). The thermoneutral control (TNC) birds were housed in a thermoneutral chamber and fed with a normal-CP diet without PM supplementation. The other six groups were kept in a HS chamber (33°C) for 8 h (1000 hours to 1800 hours). Key results After 6 weeks, feeding broiler chickens with low-CP diets had adversely affected growth performance and intestinal protease activities, while mortality rate, heterophile to lymphocyte ratio, and serum cortisol concentration of the low-CP group were lower (P < 0.05) than those of the high-CP group. Dietary PM supplementation also positively influenced (P < 0.05) average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, intestinal lipase and trypsin activities and serum T4 concentration. There were the CP × PM interactions (P < 0.05) for jejunal villus height and villus surface area, indicating that the effect of PM on these responses was more marked at the lower dietary CP contents. Conclusions Supplementation with PM can ameliorate the detrimental effects of HS on productive performance and digestive enzyme activities in broilers. The PM supplementation could improve intestinal morphology when applied to the diets of heat-stressed broilers with lower CP contents (95% and 90% of the recommendations). Implications Although growth performance was reduced by feeding low-CP diets (90% of the normal CP content), a beneficial effect was observed on the stress indicators of broilers grown in HS conditions. Dietary supplementation of PM might also be an effective strategy to alleviate the adverse effect of HS.",0

Compared to soybean meal, rapeseed meal (RSM) is a cheaper protein source that can be used in poultry diets. China is both the largest RSM and geese producer in the world. Therefore, the active use of RSM for geese diets can contribute to the development of poultry production. We found that geese had a good adaptation to the diet containing 16% dietary RSM through the investigation. Abstract The use of inexpensive nonconventional feed materials, such as rapeseed meal (RSM), could help alleviate the shortage of feed materials in the poultry industry. This study was to investigate the effects of dietary double-low RSM on growth performance, carcass traits, serum parameters, and intestinal development of geese. A total of 270 healthy 35-day-old male Jiangnan White geese were randomly divided into five treatments, with six replicate pens of nine geese each. The geese were fed five isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets containing 0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, and 16% RSM replacing dietary soybean meal for 35 days. At 35, 49, and 70 d, the BW and feed intake were recorded. All Samples were collected at 70 d of age. The results showed that dietary RSM up to 16% did not affect the BW, ADFI, ADG, and feed/gain ratio (F/G) during 35 to 49 d, 49 to 70 d, and 35 to 70 d periods (p > 0.05). At 70 d, no difference was observed in carcass yield or serum biochemical parameters among groups (p > 0.05). Dietary 12% and 16% RSM significantly increased the concentration of serum GH compared with 0%, 4%, 8% groups (p < 0.01), but serum TSH, T3 and T4 were unaffected (p > 0.05). The relative weights of heart, liver, spleen, proventriculus, gizzard, and small intestine were similar among groups (p > 0.05). However, the geese fed dietary 16% RSM had greater bursa of Fabricius than geese in the 8% group (p < 0.05). Intestinal morphology was unaffected by treatments (p > 0.05). According to the findings, dietary RSM up to 16% can be used in geese diets without impact on production performance.",0

Owing to its lower cost and abundant sulfur-containing amino acids, RSM can be used for replacing soybean meal in broiler diets. However, its use is limited by the presence of numerous anti-nutritional factors. As an ancient technique to convert the complex substrates into simple compounds by a number of microorganisms, microbial solid-state fermentation (SSF) has been shown as an effective way to eliminate or reduce anti-nutritional factors in RSM and improve growth performance when fed to animals. This improvement is not yet clear; in particular, the understanding of the feeding nutritional value of fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM) is not very well studied. Hence, the trial is conducted to investigate the effects of fermentation on standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids and apparent metabolizable energy (AME) in RSM fed to broiler chickens. According to our findings, fermentation had a significant effect on the chemical composition of RSM. In comparison to RSM, FRSM had greater nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) values and SID of amino acids. FRSM was nutritionally superior to RSM for use in broiler diets. Abstract Rapeseed meal (RSM) is a common protein ingredient in animal diets, while the proportion of RSM in diets is limited because of its anti-nutritional factors. Fermentation based on mixed microbial strains appears to be a suitable approach to improve the nutritive value of rapeseed meal in animal feed. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fermentation on the apparent metabolizable energy (AME) values and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids in RSM fed broilers. The AME and nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) values of RSM and fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM) were determined by the substitution method, with RSM and FRSM proportionally replacing the energy-yielding components of the basal diet by 30%. Results show that fermentation improved AME and AMEn of RSM from 7.44 to 8.51 MJ/kg and from 7.17 to 8.26 MJ/kg, respectively. In the second experiment, two experimental diets were formulated, with RSM and FRSM being the sole sources of amino acids. A nitrogen-free diet (NFD) was also formulated to determine endogenous amino acids losses (EAAL). Feeding on FRSM resulted in higher (p < 0.05) apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and SID of alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, lysine, arginine, and phenylalanine. No significant differences between RSM and FRSM were found for AID and SID of asparagine, histidine, threonine, serine, glutamine, praline, glycine, methionine, and cystine. FRSM had greater AMEn values and SID of amino acids compared to RSM, therefore, FRSM was nutritionally superior to RSM in broiler diets.",0

Since the mechanism of action of reproterol has not been investigated so far, its potential anti-inflammatory activity in asthma remains still unknown. Therefore, we have studied in vitro whether the theophylline component of the reproterol molecule might enhance the stimulatory effect of the β-adrenoceptor on cAMP production resulting in suppression of inflammatory mediator production. Methods: The effects of reproterol, orciprenaline and theophylline (10–9–10–5 M) on spontaneous cAMP (5 × 104 cells/30 min)- and on LPS (10 μg/ml)-stimulated LTB4 production (105 cells/4 h) were determined in normal monocytes in vitro. Results: Production of cAMP (n = 9) was significantly augmented in a dose-dependent manner by orciprenaline (30 ± 8%) and theophylline (28 ± 10%), but mostly by reproterol (127 ± 8%) at 10–5 M. Despite incubation with propranolol, significant stimulation of cAMP production was notable following reproterol therapy. Production of LTB4 was significantly inhibited by reproterol (–48 ± 14%) and less by theophylline (–28 ± 10%), but was stimulated by orciprenaline (+20 ± 8%) at 10–5 M. Conclusion: We conclude that reproterol exerts a strong stimulatory effect on monocyte cAMP production and a suppressive effect on LTB4 production possibly due to a synergistic mode of action on adenylate cyclase activity and inhibition of phosphodiesterases. More clinical studies in bronchial asthma will be needed to determine whether these results may translate into clinically relevant effects.",0

One week following the initial sequence of injections of PCA, light and electron micrographs revealed degenerate fibers in the outer zone of the median eminence. Lower drug doses or single 10-mg/kg doses did not lead to morphologic changes. Neuronal processes located in the pituitary intermediate lobe appeared normal although there was a significant increase in the numbers of secretory granules contained within intermediate lobe cells drug-treated rats, as compared to controls. Fluorometric analysis of levels of catecholamine and indoleamine showed a decrease in serotonin in median eminence and pons-medulla, but no change in that of the pituitary. Levels of dopamine and norepinephrine remained unchanged after PCA treatment. The data suggest that fibers affected in the median eminence contain serotonin. Processes in the intermediate lobe may be resistant to the serotonin-lowering effects of PCA observed in brain tissue.

HP/UWB pulses typically have durations on the order of nanoseconds, rise times of picoseconds and amplitudes around 100 kV m−1. This article reviews current research on biological effects from HP/UWB exposure. The different references were classified according to endpoints (cardiovascular system, central nervous system, behavior, genotoxicity, teratology …). The article also reviews the aspects of mechanisms of interactions and tissue damage as well as the numerical work that has been done for studying HP/UWB pulse propagation and pulse energy deposition inside biological tissues. The mechanisms proposed are the molecular conformation change, the modification of chemical reaction rates, membrane excitation and breakdown and direct electrical forces on cells or cell constituents, and the energy deposition. As regards the penetration of biological matter and the deposited energy, mainly computations were published. They have shown that the EM field inside the biological matter is strongly modified compared to the incident EM field and that the energy absorption for HP/UWB pulses occurs in the same way as for continuous waves. However, the energy carried by a HP/UWB pulse is very low and the deposited energy is low. The number of published studies dealing with the biological effects is small and only a few pointed out slight effects. It should be further noted that the animal populations used in the studies were not always large, the statistical analyses not always relevant and the teams involved in this research rather limited in number.",0

Systems emitting High Power Microwave Ultra Wide Band (HPM/UWB) pulses are developed for both military and civilian applications. The knowledge of the biological effects of this type of radiation is crucial for the protection of the staffs involved in UWB system development but also within the framework of their future uses. As no exposure standard exists, the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis has initiated a research program in this area. This program was constituted firstly by a bibliographical survey on the damage mechanisms, the dosimetry and the biological effects. At the sight of the results, it has been considered necessary to measure HPM/UWB pulse propagation in tissue-mimicking phantom materials as mainly numerical works were done on this topic. Indeed the question of the electromagnetic field amplitude in biological tissues and of the loss of energy along its propagation is crucial for the determination of damage mechanisms that can be expected. In this purpose, D-dot probes were used to measure the electric displacement field and set into materials that possess the dispersive dielectric properties of human soft tissues over the microwave frequency range, from 100 MHz to 3 GHz. Cubes of phantom materials containing D-dot were exposed to HPM/UWB pulses which have the following characteristics: a sub-nanosecond rise time, an electric field amplitude of 350 kV m-1 and a pulse duration of 3 ns. This paper will present the results of the bibliographical survey and of these experiments. Additionally, at our best knowledge, no studies dealing with the impact of HPM/UWB pulses on Active Implementable Medical Devices (AIMDs) were published. Consequently, this aspect has also been examined. Implementable Cardiac Pacemaker (ICP) was selected as AIMD since it is the most frequently implemented and it has to maintain vital functions. A bibliographic study was done to determine the in vitro experimental protocol. This latter was based, in particular, on the work performed to establish standards for the exposure of people bearing AIMDs to electromagnetic fields, on studies in the context of EMP simulator and also on studies achieved for UHF frequency range. The effects of HPM/UWB pulses on an ICP were investigated and both synchronous and asynchronous pacing modes were tested. The experimental results will also be presented.",0

In this review, computational methods that provide this information through full time-dependent solutions of Maxwell's equations are summarized briefly. This is followed by an overview of safety- and medical-related applications where modelling has contributed significantly to development and understanding of the techniques involved.

Despite an increase of the scientific research on bioeffects of exposure to non-ionizing UWB pulses, characterization of those effects is far from complete. A numerical computational approach, such as a finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method, is required to visualize and understand the complexity of broadband electromagnetic interactions. The FDTD method has almost no limits in the description of the geometrical and dispersive properties of the simulated material, it is numerically robust and appropriate for current computer technology. In this paper, a complete calculation of exposure of the human eye to UWB electromagnetic pulses in the frequency range of 3.1–10.6, 22–29 and 57–64 GHz is performed. Computation in this frequency range required a geometrical resolution of the eye of 0.1 mm and an arbitrary precision in the description of its dielectric properties in terms of the Debye model. New results show that the interaction of UWB pulses with the eye tissues exhibits the same properties as the interaction of the continuous electromagnetic waves (CWs) with the frequencies from the pulse's frequency spectrum. It is also shown that under the same exposure conditions the exposure to UWB pulses is from one to many orders of magnitude safer than the exposure to CW.",0

Results from in vitro experiments, animal models and analysis of human samples from randomized controlled trials provide comprehensive data illustrating the pleiotropic actions of Vitamin D on the immune system. They globally result in immunomodulation by decreasing differentiation of effector T and B cells while promoting regulatory subsets. Vitamin D also modulates innate immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells, and acts at the level of the blood–brain barrier reducing immune cell trafficking. Vitamin D exerts additional activity within the central nervous system reducing microglial and astrocytic activation. The immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D detected in animal models of multiple sclerosis has suggested its potential therapeutic use for treating multiple sclerosis. In this review, we focus on recent published data describing the biological effects of Vitamin D in animal models of multiple sclerosis on immune cells, blood–brain barrier function, activation of glial cells and its potential neuroprotective effects. Based on the current knowledge, we also discuss optimization of therapeutic interventions with Vitamin D in patients with multiple sclerosis, as well as new technologies allowing in-depth analysis of immune cell regulations by vitamin D.",0

However, it also exerts a broad range of extra-skeletal effects on cellular physiology and on the immune system. Vitamins D2 and D3 share a high degree of structural similarity. Functional equivalence in their vitamin D-dependent effects on human physiology is usually assumed but has in fact not been well defined experimentally. In this study we seek to redress the gap in knowledge by undertaking an in-depth examination of changes in the human blood transcriptome following supplementation with physiological doses of vitamin D2 and D3. Our work extends a previously published randomized placebo-controlled trial that recruited healthy white European and South Asian women who were given 15 µg of vitamin D2 or D3 daily over 12 weeks in wintertime in the UK (Nov-Mar) by additionally determining changes in the blood transcriptome over the intervention period using microarrays. An integrated comparison of the results defines both the effect of vitamin D3 or D2 on gene expression, and any influence of ethnic background. An important aspect of this analysis was the focus on the changes in expression from baseline to the 12-week endpoint of treatment within each individual, harnessing the longitudinal design of the study. Whilst overlap in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes was present in the D2 or D3-dependent effects identified, most changes were specific to either one vitamin or the other. The data also pointed to the possibility of ethnic differences in the responses. Notably, following vitamin D3 supplementation, the majority of changes in gene expression reflected a down-regulation in the activity of genes, many encoding pathways of the innate and adaptive immune systems, potentially shifting the immune system to a more tolerogenic status. Surprisingly, gene expression associated with type I and type II interferon activity, critical to the innate response to bacterial and viral infections, differed following supplementation with either vitamin D2 or vitamin D3, with only vitamin D3 having a stimulatory effect. This study suggests that further investigation of the respective physiological roles of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 is warranted.",0

In this randomised placebo-controlled trial, participants were given daily physiological doses (15 g) of either vitamin D2 or D3 for 12 weeks and changes in the transcriptome were compared relative to the transcriptome at baseline. While there was some overlap in the repertoire of differentially expressed genes after supplementation with each vitamin D source, most changes were specific to either vitamin D3 or vitamin D2, suggesting that each form of the vitamin may have different effects on human physiology. Notably, following vitamin D3 supplementation, the majority of changes in gene expression reflected a down-regulation in the activity of genes, many encoding components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. These are consistent with the emerging concept that vitamin D orchestrates a shift in the immune system towards a more tolerogenic status. The profound differences in gene expression after supplementation with vitamin D2 compared with vitamin D3 warrant a more intensive investigation of the biological effects of the two forms of vitamin D on human physiology.",0

Modifications in myelination alter axonal capacity to transmit electric impulses and enable pathological conditions. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes (OLs) myelinate axons, a complex process involving various cellular interactions. However, we know little about the mechanisms that orchestrate correct myelination. Here, we demonstrate that OLs express R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Using female and male mutant mice to delete these proteins, we found that activation of the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways was weaker in mice lacking one or both of these GTPases, suggesting that both proteins coordinate the activity of these two pathways. Loss of R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 diminishes the number of OLs in major myelinated CNS tracts and increases the proportion of immature OLs. In R-Ras1−/− and R-Ras2−/−-null mice, OLs show aberrant morphologies and fail to differentiate correctly into myelin-forming phenotypes. The smaller OL population and abnormal OL maturation induce severe hypomyelination, with shorter nodes of Ranvier in R-Ras1−/− and/or R-Ras2−/− mice. These defects explain the slower conduction velocity of myelinated axons that we observed in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Together, these results suggest that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are upstream elements that regulate the survival and differentiation of progenitors into OLs through the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways for proper myelination. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In this study, we show that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 play essential roles in regulating myelination in vivo and control fundamental aspects of oligodendrocyte (OL) survival and differentiation through synergistic activation of PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK signaling. Mice lacking R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 show a diminished OL population with a higher proportion of immature OLs, explaining the observed hypomyelination in main CNS tracts. In vivo electrophysiology recordings demonstrate a slower conduction velocity of nerve impulses in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Therefore, R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are essential for proper axonal myelination and accurate neural transmission.",0

Herein, this study aims to assess the association between possible new sarcopenia and the depression trajectory of individuals and their intimate partners through a 4-year longitudinal cohort study. Methods Our study included 784 pairs of individuals without possible sarcopenia and their spouses from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2011. All individuals and their spouses received three assessments of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 10-item (CESD-10) scale in 2011, 2013, and 2015. According to the diagnostic algorithm recommended by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019, we evaluated the incidence of possible sarcopenia in individuals in 2015. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify a longitudinal depression trajectory of individuals and their spouses during a 4-year follow-up. Subsequently, we assessed the relationship between possible sarcopenia and depression trajectory using three generalized additive models. Results In 2015, 24.87% (195/784) of individuals were diagnosed with possible sarcopenia. LCA identified five depression trajectories: a persistently high risk of depression in individuals and their spouses (reference; class 1 = 34 [4.3%]); a persistently low risk of depression in individuals and their spouses (class 2 = 526 [67.1%]); a high risk of depression in individuals and a low risk of depression in spouses (class 3 = 46 [5.9%]); a low risk of depression in individuals and a high risk of depression in spouses (class 4 = 116 [14.8%]); and a reduced risk of depression in individuals and their spouses (class 5 = 62 [7.9%]). The highest incidence of possible sarcopenia was shown in class 1, followed by classes 3 and 5. Classes 2 (adjusted relative risk (RR) = 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.20–0.97) and 4 (adjusted RR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.17–0.96) had a significantly lower incidence of possible sarcopenia than class 1. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the incidence of possible sarcopenia in class 4 was obviously higher in women (38.89%) than in men (18.4%). Conclusions Our study indicates a persistently high risk of depression in individuals to develop possible sarcopenia. In addition, a persistently high risk of depression in intimate partners potentially increases the risk of possible new sarcopenia, especially in female individuals who are at low risk of depression.",0

Despite the progress in the treatment of localized prostate cancer, there is still lack of effective therapies for the advanced forms of the disease. Most patients with advanced prostate cancer become resistant to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which remains the main therapeutic option in this setting, and progress to lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Current therapies for prostate cancer preferentially target proliferating, partially differentiated, and AR-dependent cancer cells that constitute the bulk of the tumor mass. However, the subpopulation of tumor-initiating or tumor-propagating stem-like cancer cells is virtually resistant to the standard treatments causing tumor relapse at the primary or metastatic sites. Understanding the pathways controlling the establishment, expansion and maintenance of the cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation is an important step toward the development of more effective treatment for prostate cancer, which might enable ablation or exhaustion of CSCs and prevent treatment resistance and disease recurrence. In this review, we focus on the impact of transcriptional regulators on phenotypic reprogramming of prostate CSCs and provide examples supporting the possibility of inhibiting maintenance and expansion of the CSC pool in human prostate cancer along with the currently available methodological approaches. Transcription factors are key elements for instructing specific transcriptional programs and inducing CSC-associated phenotypic changes implicated in disease progression and treatment resistance. Recent studies have shown that interfering with these processes causes exhaustion of CSCs with loss of self-renewal and tumorigenic capability in prostate cancer models. Targeting key transcriptional regulators in prostate CSCs is a valid therapeutic strategy waiting to be tested in clinical trials.",0

As the IoT devices in the smart grid ecosystem generate a gigantic amount of data that needs to be stored and managed in the cloud server. On the other hand, the stored data in the cloud server can be accessible to a number of data users, therefore the data need authenticity and secrecy. Here, to fulfill the security requirements of such type of communication, signcryption with proxy re-encryption technique is the most suitable option where a semi-trusted third party can alter a ciphertext that has been encrypted for one user into another ciphertext without seeing the original content of the message. However, the existing signcryption with proxy re-encryption schemes for the smart grid environment is suffering from more bandwidth space and greater computational time requirements. Thus, in this paper, we propose a lightweight certificate-based signcryption with a proxy re-encryption (CBSRE) scheme for smart grid based-IoT devices with the intention of reducing the computational and communicational costs. For the security and efficiency of the proposed CBSRE scheme, we used a hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem that uses small parameters with a key size of 80-bits. Furthermore, the proposed scheme provides the security requirements of confidentiality (IND-CBSRE-CCA2-I and IND-CBSRE-CCA2-II), unforgeability (EUF-CBSRE-CMA-I and EUF-CBSRE-CMA-II) and forward secrecy. Additionally, we compared our proposed CBSRE scheme with the existing proxy signcryption with re-encryption schemes and the final results show that the new scheme provides strong security with the expanse of minimal computational and communications resources.",0

By mere behavioral inference from usage reports, its viable to adjudge the daily routine, location, and the kind of electrical devices of a customer. The collection and transmission of such data raises security concerns. Hence, its vital to secure ESP’s access to a customer’s data. In perspective of this, we introduce a data access control scheme which is suitable for smart grids with secure customer data access. In our scheme, the customer is a data owner while an ESP or other third party stakeholder (TPS) is the data user. A data user can have secure access to a customer’s data via a gateway device such as energy service interface (ESI). The ESI fits in as proxy that re-encrypts data for authorized data users based on the delegation command from the data owner. Here, ESI is unable to acquire plaintext information on the data. Moreover, only authorized data users are eligible for decrypting and verifying the integrity and authentication of data. We achieve the data access control via a certificateless signcryption with proxy re-encryption (CLSPRE) scheme. Detailed security analysis shows that our CLSPRE scheme is secure in the random oracle model (ROM). Moreover, extensive performance evaluation indicates its efficiency with respect to communication overhead and computation complexity.",0

In this paper, we propose a highly efficient identity based signcryption scheme and add a proxy re-encryption feature to it. This allows users to store signed and encrypted data in the cloud, where the cloud server provider is able to check the authentication but not to derive the content of the message. When another user requests data access, the originator of the message first checks the authorization and then provides the cloud server an encryption key to re-encrypt the stored data, enabling the requesting party to decrypt the resulting ciphertext and to validate the signature. The proposed scheme is based on elliptic curve operations and does not use compute intensive pairing operations, like previous proposals.",0

To achieve long-range detection and cover wide field of regard, we mounted two separate sets of PTU integrated with visible light camera on both sides of the runway instead of our previous assembled stereo vision system. Then, the well-known AdaBoost method was evaluated with regard to detecting and tracking the target. To achieve the relative position between the UAV and landing area, we used triangulation to calculate the 3D coordinates of the UAV.

White spots can appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment because of early decay around the brace attachments. Fluoride is effective at reducing decay in susceptible individuals and is routinely prescribed in various different forms to patients during orthodontic treatment.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the effectiveness of fluoride in preventing white spots during orthodontic treatment and to compare the different modes of delivery of fluoride.


SEARCH STRATEGY
We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 22 August 2002); CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002); MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2003); EMBASE (January 1980 to week July 2003). Authors of trials were contacted for further data.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: a randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trial, involving the use of a fluoride-containing product compared with no use or use of a non-fluoride control and enamel demineralisation was assessed during or after orthodontic treatment.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Six reviewers independently, in duplicate, extracted data. The primary outcome was the difference in the presence or absence of white spots between experimental and control patients for parallel design studies, and between experimental and control quadrants, for split-mouth design studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken for the items assessed for quality and publication bias.


MAIN RESULTS
The primary outcome of the review was the presence or absence of white spots by patient at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included any quantitative assessment of enamel mineral loss or lesion depth. Other outcomes such as differences in size and severity of white spots, any patient based outcomes, such as perception of white spots could not be included because there were insufficient data. Fifteen trials, with 723 participants, provided data for this review. None of the studies fulfilled all of the methodological quality assessment criteria. There is some evidence that a daily sodium fluoride mouthrinse reduces the severity of enamel decay surrounding a fixed brace (weighted mean difference for lesion depth -70.0; 95% CI -118.2 to -21.8) and that use of a glass ionomer cement for bracket bonding reduces the prevalence (Peto OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.84) and severity of white spots (weighted mean difference for mineral loss -645 vol%.microm; 95% CI -915 to -375) compared with composite resins.


REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS
There is some evidence that the use of topical fluoride or fluoride-containing bonding materials during orthodontic treatment reduces the occurrence and severity of white spot lesions, however there is little evidence as to which method or combination of methods to deliver the fluoride is the most effective. Based on current best practice in other areas of dentistry, for which there is evidence, we recommend that patients with fixed braces rinse daily with a 0.05% sodium fluoride mouthrinse. More high quality, clinical research is required into the different modes of delivering fluoride to the orthodontic patient.",0

Based on our previous pilot study, the objective of this extended study was to compare (a) casts to their corresponding digital ClinCheck® models at baseline and (b) the tooth movement achieved at the end of aligner therapy (Invisalign®) to the predicted movement in the anterior region.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pre- and post-treatment casts as well as initial and final ClinChecks® models of 50 patients (15-63 years of age) were analyzed. All patients were treated with Invisalign® (Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Evaluated parameters were: upper/lower anterior arch length and intercanine distance, overjet, overbite, dental midline shift, and the irregularity index according to Little. The comparison achieved/predicted tooth movement was tested for equivalence [adjusted 98.57% confidence interval (- 1.00; + 1.00)].


RESULTS
Before treatment the anterior crowding, according to Little, was on average 5.39 mm (minimum 1.50 mm, maximum 14.50 mm) in the upper dentition and 5.96 mm (minimum 2.00 mm, maximum 11.50 mm) in the lower dentition. After treatment the values were reduced to 1.57 mm (minimum 0 mm, maximum 4.5 mm) in the maxilla and 0.82 mm (minimum 0 mm, maximum 2.50 mm) in the mandible. We found slight deviations between pretreatment casts and initialClinCheck® ranging on average from -0.08 mm (SD ± 0.29) for the overjet and up to -0.28 mm (SD ± 0.46) for the upper anterior arch length. The difference between achieved/predicted tooth movements ranged on average from 0.01 mm (SD ± 0.48) for the lower anterior arch length, up to 0.7 mm (SD ± 0.87) for the overbite. All parameters were significantly equivalent except for the overbite (-1.02; -0.39).


CONCLUSION
Performed with aligners (Invisalign®), the resolvement of the partly severe anterior crowding was successfully accomplished. Resolving lower anterior crowding by protrusion of the anterior teeth (i.e., enlargement of the anterior arch length) seems well predictable. The initial ClinCheck® models provided high accuracy compared to the initial casts. The achieved tooth movement was in concordance with the predicted movement for all parameters, except for the overbite.",0

When the maxillary incisor display is correct, maxillary incisor intrusion is unnecessary; treatment should involve intrusion and leveling of the mandibular anterior teeth to avoid flattening of the smile arc. 2 Any maxillary incisor intrusion or mandibular leveling should be carefully monitored during treatment to maintain proper incisor exposure while effectively correcting the deep bite. After the development of thermoformed appliances that could be used for minor tooth movements, 3-7 the Invisalign* system was introduced for treatment of moderate malocclusions. 8-13 In 2004, Wheeler reported that Invisalign could be used in patients with anterior and posterior crossbites, deep bites, anterior open bites or shallow overbites, and periodontal problems. 14 The present article describes the use of Invisalign appliances for the correction of deep bite in adult patients with normal skeletal patterns. Case 1 A 23-year-old female presented with a Class I malocclusion, a deep bite, and mild crowding in both arches (Fig. 1). Treatment involved 23 upper and 29 lower aligners. After 15 months of initial treatment, another six months of Case Refinement was needed to finish the lower alignment (Figs. 2,3). The upper and lower crowding was corrected with interproximal reduction. The deep bite was opened by leveling the mandibular arch, using controlled proclination of the mandibular incisors and only slight intrusion of the maxillary incisors, thus maintaining the smile arc. The patient’s good posterior occlusal relationship was preserved.",0

The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature to determine the treatment effects of the Invisalign orthodontic system (Align Technology), Santa Clara, Calif.).


TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED
The authors reviewed clinical trials that assessed Invisalign's treatment effects in nongrowing patients. They did not consider trials involving surgical or other simultaneous fixed or removable orthodontic treatment interventions.


RESULTS
The authors searched electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, EMBASE Excerpta Medica, Thomsen's ISI Web of Science and LILACS) with the help of a senior health sciences librarian. They used ""Invisalign"" as the sole search term, and 22 documents appeared in the combined search. Thereafter, they used ""clinical trials,"" ""humans"" and ""Invisalign treatment effects"" as abstract selection criteria. Only two published articles met these inclusion criteria, though after reading the actual articles, the authors determined that they did not adequately evaluate Invisalign treatment effects. Both articles identified methodological issues.


CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
The inadequately designed studies the authors found represented only a lower level of evidence (level II). Therefore, the authors found that no strong conclusions could be made regarding the treatment effects of Invisalign appliances. Future prospective randomized clinical trials are required to support, with sound scientific evidence, the claims about Invisalign's treatment effects. Clinicians will have to rely on their Invisalign clinical experience, the opinions of experts and the limited published evidence when using Invisalign appliances.",0

Pulse-forming lines based on gas spark gap are the main means to generate high-voltage nanosecond short pulses; but due to electrode ablation, it is difficult to operate at MHz repetition rates. The topologies based on the fully controlled semiconductor device can output multimode nanosecond pulse. But it is limited by the gate driver ability and system stray loss, so it is difficult to directly generate flexible and adjustable nanosecond short pulse with MHz repetition rates. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, this article proposes the Blumlein-based LC underdamped oscillation boost circuit and the Blumlein stack topology to achieve high voltage gain. And, the voltage wave process can be adjusted by controlling the switching sequence to change operating mode. Finally, multimode operation such as positive polarity, negative polarity, bipolar and pulse duration modulation can be realized with MHz repetition rates and high gain voltage.",0

The test stand includes three rf ports with independent phase and power control, beamline supports designed for rapid reconfiguration, and a control and diagnostics system based on the design of the APS linac. The beamline design features a high-resolution electron spectrometer that includes provision for operation as a dispersion-free dogleg, and a rapidly reconfigurable gun-to-spectrometer transport line. Picosecond and nanosecond photocathode drive lasers are available; the room shielding is also adequate for the high average beam powers typically produced by thermionic-cathode rf guns. The initially installed gun is a ballistic-compression gun, which requires all three rf ports to be connected to the gun. Plans include the installation of a higher-order mode photoinjector, requiring one rf connection; this will free the other ports to provide power to a small TW linac section and deflector cavity for bunch-length measurements. The test stand is also capable of being used as an operator training facility, and serves as a validation facility and test bed for the APS main injector rf guns.",0

However, the improvement of the flow rate of the piezoelectric micropump relies on the increase in size and driving voltage, which hinders its application in the implantable medical field. This article proposes a double-layer chamber valveless piezoelectric micropump, which has the obvious advantages of small size and adjustable flow rate, and is expected to be applied to the treatment of implantable hydrocephalus. The overall size of the micropump is 10 mm × 10 mm × 4 mm, which can be implanted in the cerebral cortex. Combined with polydimethylsiloxane-polyethylene glycol terephthalate bonding technology, the double-layer chamber micropump solves the contradiction between miniaturization and large flow range. The flow rate generated by micropump under low voltage can be adjusted according to the amount of hydrocephalus. In order to reveal the mechanism of increasing the flow rate, the working efficiencies of the microvalve and micropump are studied in this article. The electric-solid-fluid coupling simulation and experimental tests obtained the optimal structural parameters: the divergence angle is 30°, the throat width is 300 μm, and the upper chamber depth is 100 μm. The proposed micropump can achieve the tunable flow rate of 2.16–51.74 μl min−1.",0

As adults with schizophrenia age, they may use many medications, i.e., have polypharmacy. While psychiatric polypharmacy is well documented, little is known about trends and patterns of global polypharmacy. This study aimed to draw a portrait of polypharmacy among older adults with schizophrenia from 2000 to 2016. Methods: This population-based cohort study was conducted using the data of the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System of the National Institute of Public Health of Quebec to characterize recent trends and patterns of medication use according to age and sex. We identified all Quebec residents over 65 years with an ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia between 2000 and 2016. We calculated the total number of medications used by every individual each year and the age-standardized proportion of individuals with polypharmacy, as defined by the usage of 5+, 10+, 15+, and 20+ different medications yearly. We identified the clinical and socio-demographic factors associated with polypharmacy using robust Poisson regression models considering the correlation of the responses between subjects and analyzed trends in the prevalence of different degrees of polypharmacy. Results: From 2000 to 2016, the median number of medications consumed yearly rose from 8 in 2000 to 11 in 2016. The age-standardized proportion of people exposed to different degrees of polypharmacy also increased from 2000 to 2016: 5+ drugs: 76.6%–89.3%; 10+ drugs: 36.9%–62.2%; 15+: 13.3%–34.4%; 20+: 3.9%–14.4%. Non-antipsychotic drugs essentially drove the rise in polypharmacy since the number of antipsychotics remained stable (mean number of antipsychotics consumed: 1.51 in 2000 vs. 1.67 in 2016). In the multivariate regression, one of the main clinically significant factor associated with polypharmacy was the number of comorbidities (e.g., Polypharmacy-10+: RR[2 VS. 0–1] = 1.4; 99% IC:1.3–1.4, RR[3–4] = 1.7 (1.7–1.8); RR[5+] = 2.1 (2.1–2.2); Polypharmacy-15+: RR[2 VS 0–1] = 1.6; 99% IC:1.5–1.7, RR[3–4] = 2.5 (2.3–2.7); RR[5+] = 4.1 (3.8–4.5). Conclusion: There was a noticeable increase in polypharmacy exposure among older adults with schizophrenia in recent years, mainly driven by non-antipsychotic medications. This raises concerns about the growing risks for adverse effects and drug-drug interactions in this vulnerable population.",0

We aimed to describe the trends in polypharmacy and medication use in older adults with heart failure. Methods: We performed a study including all adults >65 years with heart failure between 2000 and 2017 using health administrative databases in Quebec, Canada. Medication use was ascertained by the presence of at least one claim in each year. We defined three levels of polypharmacy: ⩾10, ⩾15 and ⩾20 different medications/year, and evaluated the use of guideline-recommended and potentially inappropriate medications. We calculated age- and sex-standardized proportions of users each year. Results: The use of ⩾10, ⩾15 and ⩾20 medications increased from 62.2%, 30.6% and 12.2% in 2000 to 71.9%, 43.9% and 22.7%, respectively, in 2017. The combination of β-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) was used by 30.4% of individuals in 2000 and 45.5% in 2017. ACEI/ARB users decreased from 65.8% in 2000 to 62.1% in 2017. Potentially inappropriate medication use decreased over time. Conclusion: Polypharmacy is significant among older adults with heart failure. Implications of such medication burden should be investigated.",0

Although fractures are the principal manifestation of osteoporosis, very few algorithms are available to identify individuals at high risk of osteoporotic fractures in current surveillance systems. The objective of this study was to derive and validate predictive models to accurately identify individuals at high risk of osteoporotic fracture using information available in healthcare administrative data. More than 270,000 men and women aged ≥66 years were randomly selected from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System. Selected individuals were followed between fiscal years 2006–2007 and 2015–2016. Models were constructed for prediction of hip/femur and major osteoporotic fractures for follow‐up periods of 5 and 10 years. A total of 62 potential predictors measurable in healthcare administrative databases were identified. Predictor selection was performed using a manual backward algorithm. The predictive performance of the final models was assessed using measures of discrimination, calibration, and overall performance. Between 20 and 25 predictors were retained in the final prediction models (eg, age, sex, social deprivation index, most of the major and minor risk factors for osteoporosis, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, cognitive impairment, anemia, anxio‐depressive disorders). Discrimination of the final models was higher for the prediction of hip/femur fracture than major osteoporotic fracture and higher for prediction for a 5‐year than a 10‐year period (hip/femur fracture for 5 years: c‐index = 0.77; major osteoporotic fracture for 5 years: c‐index = 0.71; hip/femur fracture for 10 years: c‐index = 0.73; major osteoporotic fracture for 10 years: c‐index = 0.68). The predicted probabilities globally agreed with the observed probabilities. In conclusion, the derived models had adequate predictive performance in internal validation. As a final step, these models should be validated in an external cohort and used to develop indicators for surveillance of osteoporosis. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).",0

Homomorphic encryption has recently attracted attention as a key solution to preserve privacy in machine learning applications. However, current approaches on the training of encrypted machine learning have relied heavily on hyperparameter selection, which should be avoided owing to the extreme difficulty of conducting validation on encrypted data. In this study, we propose an effective privacy-preserving logistic regression method that is free from the approximation of the sigmoid function and hyperparameter selection. In our framework, a logistic regression model can be transformed into the corresponding ridge regression for the logit function. We provide a theoretical background for our framework by suggesting a new generalization error bound on the encrypted data. Experiments on various real-world data show that our framework achieves better classification results while reducing latency by ∼ 68%, compared to the previous models.",0

In vitro reproduction of trabecular bone microenvironment would be valuable not only for developing a functional scaffold for bone marrow tissue engineering but also for understanding its biological functions. Herein, we analyzed and reproduced the initial stages of trabecular bone formation in mouse femur epiphysis. We identified that the trabecular bone formation progressed through the following steps: (i) partial rupture of hypertrophic chondrocytes; (ii) calcospherite formation on cell membrane nano fragments (CNFs) derived from the ruptured cells; and (iii) calcospherite growth and fusion to form the initial three-dimensional (3D) structure of trabecular bones. For reproducing the initial trabecular bone formation in vitro, we collected CNFs from cultured cells and used as nucleation sites for biomimetic calcospherite formation. Strikingly, almost the same 3D structure of the initial trabecular bone could be obtained in vitro by using additional CNFs as a binder to fuse biomimetic calcospherites.",0

This study compares the structural and compositional differences between bone apatite clusters formed in intramembranous (IO) and endochondral ossification (EO). Calvaria (IO) and femurs (EO) are isolated from mice at embryonic days (E) 14.5 to 15.5 and post‐natal days (P) 6 to 7, respectively. Results show that the initially formed bone apatite clusters in EO (≅1.2 µm2) are >10 times larger than those in IO (≅0.1 µm2), without significant changes in ion composition. In IO (E14.5 calvarium), early minerals are formed inside matrix vesicles (MVs). In contrast, in EO (P6 femur epiphysis), no MVs are observed, and chondrocyte‐derived plasma membrane nanofragments (PMNFs) are the nucleation site for mineralization. Apatite cluster size difference is linked with the different nucleation sites. Moreover, an alkaline pH and slow P supply into a Ca‐rich microenvironment are suggested to facilitate apatite cluster growth, as demonstrated in a biomimetic mineralization system. Together, the results reveal for the first time the distinct and exquisite microstructures of bone apatite clusters in IO and EO, and provide insightful inspirations for the design of more efficient materials for bone tissue engineering and repair.",0

Future researches are expected to incorporate more advanced techniques toward achieving rapid bone repair and modulation of the regenerated bone quality. For these purposes, it is important to have a more integrative understanding of the mechanisms of bone formation and maturation from multiple perspectives and to incorporate these new concepts into the development and designing of novel materials and techniques for bone regeneration. This review focuses on the analysis of the earliest stages of bone tissue development from the biology, material science, and engineering perspectives for a more integrative understanding of bone formation and maturation, and for the development of novel biology-based engineering approaches for tissue synthesis in vitro. More specifically, the authors describe the systematic methodology that allowed the understanding of the different nucleation sites in intramembranous and endochondral ossification, the space-making process for mineral formation and growth, as well as the process of apatite crystal cluster growth in vivo in the presence of suppressing biomolecules. Impact Statement A detailed understanding of the developmental process of bone tissue leads to the acquisition of useful information for the bone tissue fabrication. This review summarizes the study of the calcification process of the calvaria and epiphyses from an engineering perspective and provides useful information for the realization of bone tissue biofabrication. Here, we describe the new mechanism of space formation for mineralization such as rupture of chondrocytes and disruption of cell-cell adhesion. We also describe the roles of nucleation site such as cell membrane nanofragments and matrix vesicles.",0

Here, we focused on the teleost fish ribs showing flexible and tough mechanical properties to obtain a deeper insight into the structural and functional features of bone tissue from different species, which would be valuable for the superior design of bone-mimicking materials. Herein, we examined their compositions, microstructure, histology, and mechanical properties. The first rib of Carassius langsdorfii showed a higher Young’s modulus with a small region of chondrocyte clusters compared with other smaller ribs. In addition, highly oriented collagen fibers and osteocytes were observed in the first rib, indicating that the longest first rib would be more mature. Moreover, the layer-by-layer structure of the oriented bone collagen was observed in each rib. These microarchitectural and compositional findings of fish rib bone would give one the useful idea to reproduce such a highly flexible rib bone-like material.",0

Therefore, novel techniques to promote rapid 3D bone-like tissue synthesis in vitro are still required. In this study, we explored the concept of using cell nanofragments as a substrate material to promote rapid bone formation in vitro. The methods for cell nanofragment fabrication were ultrasonication (30 s and 3 min), non-ionic detergent (triton 0.1% and 1%), or freeze-dried powder. The results showed that ultrasonication for 3 min allowed the fabrication of homogeneous nanofragments of less than 150 nm in length, which mineralized surprisingly in just one day, faster than the fragments obtained from all other methods. Further optimization of culture conditions indicated that a concentration of 10 mM or 100 mM of β-glycerophosphate enhanced, whereas fetal bovine serum (FBS) inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, the mineralization of the cell nanofragments. Finally, a 3D collagen-cell nanofragment-mineral complex mimicking a bone-like structure was generated in just two days by combining the cell nanofragments in collagen gel. In conclusion, sonication for three min could be applied as a novel method to fabricate cell nanofragments of less than 150 nm in length, which can be used as a material for in vitro bone tissue engineering.",0

Calcite also attracts attention in medical science and pharmacy as a primary or intermediate component in biomaterials because it possesses excellent biocompatibility along with suitable physicochemical properties. Calcite blocks have already been used during surgical procedures as a bone substitute for reconstructing bone defects formed by diseases and injury. When producing CaCO3 biomaterials and bioceramics, in particular, in vivo control of the size and polymorphic nature of CaCO3 is required. In this study, we investigated the effects of PO4 on calcite formation during the phase conversion of calcium sulfate anhydrate (CaSO4, CSA), which is sometimes used as a starting material for bone substitutes because of its suitable setting ability. CSA powder was immersed in 2 mol/L Na2CO3 solution containing a range of PO4 concentrations (0–60 mmol/L) at 40 °C for 3 days. The treated samples were investigated by X‑ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X‑ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. In addition, the fine structures of the treated samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and the specific surface area was measured. We found that PO4, which is universally present in vivo, can modulate the calcite crystal size during calcite formation. A fluorescence study and calcite crystal growth experiments indicated that PO4 adsorbs tightly onto the surface of calcite, inhibiting crystal growth. In the presence of high PO4 concentrations, vaterite is formed along with calcite, and the appearance and stability of the CaCO3 polymorphs can be controlled by adjusting the PO4 concentration. These findings have implications for medical science and pharmacology, along with mineralogy and geochemistry.",0

Herein, we show the presence of ""intermediate water"" on an inorganic solid material, hydroxyapatite. In vitro experiments revealed that Mg substitution of apatite significantly enriched the amount of intermediate water, possibly due to the proton transfer to a hydrogen-bonded network of water around HPO42- on divalent-cation-deficient apatite surfaces. The intermediate water formation related to a markedly suppressed protein adsorption on apatite. Analysis of bone apatites suggested that the intermediate water on minerals could play crucial roles in regulating crystal growth.",0

Therefore, the objectives of this study were first, to perform a systematic and ultrastructural investigation of the initial mineral formation during intramembranous ossification of mouse calvaria from a material scientists' viewpoint, and to develop novel mineralization methods based on the in vivo findings. First, the very initial mineral deposition was found to occur at embryonic day E14.0 in mouse calvaria. Analysis of the initial bone formation process showed that it involved the following distinct steps: collagen secretion, matrix vesicle (MV) release, MV mineralization, MV rupture, and collagen fiber mineralization. Next, we performed in vitro mineralization experiments using MVs and hydrogel scaffolds. Intact MVs embedded in collagen gel did not mineralize, whereas, interestingly, MV nanofragments obtained by ultrasonication could promote rapid mineralization.

In this work, mineralized collagen fibrils were prepared in the presence of citrate and Eu3+. Citrate is an indispensable and essential structural/functional component of bone. Eu3+ endows the mineralized fibrils of the necessary luminescent features to be potentially employed as a diagnostic tool in biomedical applications. The assembly and mineralization of collagen were performed by the neutralization method, which consists in adding dropwise a Ca(OH)2 solution to a H3PO4 solution containing the dispersed type I collagen until neutralization. In the absence of citrate, the resultant collagen fibrils were mineralized with nanocrystalline apatites. When citrate was added in the titrant solution in a Citrate/Ca molar ratio of 2 or 1, it acted as an inhibitor of the transformation of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) to nanocrystalline apatite. The addition of Eu3+ and citrate in the same titrant solution lead to the formation of Eu3+–doped citrate–coated ACP/collagen fibrils. Interestingly, the relative luminescent intensity and luminescence lifetime of this latter composite were superior to those of Eu3+–doped apatite/collagen prepared in absence of citrate. The cytocompatibility tests, evaluated by the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) colorimetric assay in a dose–dependent manner on GTL–16 human gastric carcinoma cells, on MG–63 human osteosarcoma cells and on the m17.ASC, a spontaneously immortalized mouse mesenchymal stem cell clone from subcutaneous adipose tissue, show that, in general, all samples are highly cytocompatible.",0

A deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind bone mineralization at different size scales, and using a multidisciplinary approach, may uncover novel pathways for the design and fabrication of functional bone tissue in vitro. The objectives of this study were first to investigate the environmental factors that prime initial mineralization using the secondary ossification center as an in vivo model, and then to apply the obtained knowledge for rapid in vitro synthesis of bone-like tissue. First, the direct and robust measurement of pH showed that femur epiphysis is alkaline (pH ≅ 8.5) at the initial mineral stage at post-natal day 6. We showed that the alkaline milieu is decisive not only for alkaline phosphatase activity, which precedes mineral formation at P6, but also for determining initial mineral precipitation and spherical morphology. Next, engineering approaches were used to synthesize bone-like tissue based on alkaline milieu and artificial chondrocyte membrane nanofragments, previously shown to be the nucleation site for mineral formation. Interestingly, mineralization using artificial cell membrane nanofragments was achieved in just 1 day. Finally, ex vivo culture of femur epiphysis in alkaline pH strongly induced chondrocyte burst, which was previously shown to be the origin of chondrocyte membrane nanofragments, and also enhanced mineral formation. Taken together, these findings not only shed more light on the microenvironmental conditions that prime initial bone formation in vivo, but they also show that alkaline milieu can be used as an important factor for enhancing methods for in vitro synthesis of bone tissue.",0

Its formation can be considered to be an aggregation process. Although aggregation of ACP is of interest for both gaining a fundamental understanding of biominerals formation and in the synthesis of novel materials, it has still not been investigated in detail. In this work, the ACP aggregation was followed by two widely applied techniques suitable for following nanoparticles aggregation in general: dynamic light scattering (DLS) and laser diffraction (LD). In addition, the ACP formation was followed by potentiometric measurements and formed precipitates were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that aggregation of ACP particles is a process which from the earliest stages simultaneously takes place at wide length scales, from nanometers to micrometers, leading to a highly polydisperse precipitation system, with polydispersity and vol. % of larger aggregates increasing with concentration. Obtained results provide insight into developing a way of regulating ACP and consequently CaP formation by controlling aggregation on the scale of interest.",0

Currently, the majority of the scaffolds produced are not representative of the complex arrangement of natural structures, since the internal morphologies follow an orthogonal and regular pattern. In order to produce scaffolds that more closely replicate the structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tissues, herein both circular and sinusoidal scaffolds were fabricated and compared to their conventional orthogonal counterparts. This is an innovative, versatile and efficient strategy to 3D print PCL scaffolds with unique curved geometries. The morphology and the mechanical behavior of the scaffolds were assessed. The biological response was analyzed by evaluating the cell seeding efficiency, cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic activity of an osteoblastic-like cell line seeded in these scaffolds. The scaffolds were designed and produced to have a similar porosity of about 56%. The non-orthogonal structures demonstrated lead to higher values of Young's modulus, both under dry conditions and when immersed in PBS. Moreover, the biological data corroborate that non-orthogonal scaffolds influence the cellular responses in a positive manner, namely in the osteogenic activity when compared with the orthogonal controls. These results suggest that introducing less orthogonal elements, which better mimic the tissue ECM and architecture, may have a positive influence on the cellular behavior, being a potential strategy to address bone tissue engineering applications.",0

In this study, we analyzed the initial steps of mineral formation during secondary ossification of mouse femur based on biological and bioengineering approaches. We first found that some chondrocytes burst near the mineralized area. External factors that could trigger chondrocyte burst were then investigated. Chondrocyte burst was shown to be modulated by mechanical and osmotic pressure. A hypotonic solution, as well as mechanical stress, significantly induced chondrocyte burst. We further hypothesized that chondrocyte burst could be associated with space-making for mineral expansion. In fact, ex vivo culture of femur epiphysis in hypotonic conditions, or under mechanical pressure, enhanced mineral formation, compared to normal culture conditions. Additionally, the effect of mechanical pressure on bone formation in vivo was investigated by immobilization of mouse lower limbs to decrease the body pressure onto the joints. The results showed that limb immobilization suppressed bone formation. Together, these results suggest chondrocyte burst as a novel fate of chondrocytes, and that manipulation of chondrocyte burst with external mechano-chemical stimuli could be an additional approach for cartilage and bone tissue engineering.",0

It is distinguished by a retroesophageal descending aorta that subsequently travels down the right side of the thoracic vertebrae towards the aortic hiatus. Nonetheless, its embryological origin ought not to be overly generalized, but each case should be considered individually due to its unique vascular patterns. This study presents a description of a LCA in a 94-year-old male cadaver. The dissection revealed the descending aorta posteriorly from the trachea and esophagus and then laterally on the right from the thoracic vertebral bodies. The branching pattern of the aortic arch was typical, so was the course of the left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves. However, the thoracic duct was placed on the right, and drained into the right internal carotid vein. Due to the normal appearance of the ascending part and the arch of the aorta, it is safe to presume that the variation originated from the persistent right dorsal aorta, with the retroesophageal part from the persistent left dorsal aorta. Detailed understanding of the variations of the thoracic aorta, and the anomalies associated with the LCA, can help to improve management of these conditions, and with that, improve patients' overall outcomes.

No commercial reuse. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. DESCRIPTION A 59yearold man with a medical history of hypertension presented to the hospital with chest discomfort with swallowing and a feeling of food ‘getting stuck’ in his chest on swallowing solids. The patient had dyspnoea on exertion but denied any orthopnoea, dizziness, lower extremity swelling or palpitations. On physical examination, his blood pressure was significantly elevated to 250/130 mm Hg, and breath sounds were slightly diminished bilaterally on auscultation without any wheezing or crackles. On presentation, his troponin I was elevated to 4.65 ng/L (0.00–0.06 ng/L), which increased to 32.6 ng/L. ECG did not show any STsegment or Twave changes. CT of the neck with contrast showed a nonspecific narrowing of the supraglottic airway without any mass or fluid collection and a retrooesophageal/retrotracheal aberrant right subclavian artery (figure 1). The patient was started on aspirin, ticagrelor, intravenous heparin and atorvastatin. Left coronary angiogram through right radial access showed a proximal occlusion of the left circumflex artery, and a drugeluting stent was placed. Arteria lusoria accounted for the clinical dysphagia that the patient reported as his oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was found to be negative. This case illustrates the significance of an anomalous retrooesophageal right subclavian artery resulting in dysphagia symptoms that may be found incidentally on the coronary angiogram. Anomalous right subclavian artery (ARSA) is also known as arteria lusoria. It is one of the most common aortic arch anomalies with a prevalence of around 0.5%–2.5% in the general population. The right subclavian artery originates as the last branch of the aortic arch, travels towards and then down the right arm after crossing the midline of the body commonly, between the oesophagus and vertebral column (80% of cases) and less commonly, between the trachea and oesophagus (15% of cases). Most patients remain symptomfree throughout their lifetime, while others can develop symptoms of dysphagia, dyspnoea, coughing, pyrosis, retrosternal pain, acute limb ischaemia and even Horner’s syndrome. The clinical manifestations of arteria lusoria result from the compression of the oesophagus by the anteriorly placed right common carotid artery and trachea with the posteriorly coursing right subclavian artery. In 0.05%–0.1% of the population, dysphagia lusoria can also result from a left subclavian artery in the presence of a rightsided aortic arch and leftsided ligamentous arteriosum, which causes more severe symptoms due to the formation of a true vascular ring that constricts the oesophagus and trachea more significantly compared with the ARSA. Our patient presented with chest pain secondary to a nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction and dysphagia, which was secondary to a retrooesophageal aberrant right subclavian artery. Patients are usually treated symptomatically with proton pump inhibitors, alcohol and smoking cessation, but surgical intervention may be required if symptoms become severe and intractable.

However, when symptomatic, it is most commonly associated with dysphagia. ARSA has also been noted as a location of potentially severe aneurysms in some patients, as well as posing a risk during surgical interventions in the esophageal region. This case study analyzes two individuals with ARSA morphology in comparison to a normal sample in order to gain a better anatomical understanding of this anomaly, potentially leading to better risk assessment of ARSA patients going forward. The diameter of the ARSA vessel was found to be substantially larger than both the right subclavian artery and brachiocephalic trunk of the subjects with classic aortic arch anatomy. As many ARSA individuals are asymptomatic, we hypothesize that the relative size of the ARSA may dictate its contribution to the presence and/or severity of associated symptomatology.",0

Since the initial discovery of bone morphogenetic protein in calcified human atherosclerotic lesions, decades of research have now led to the recognition that the regulatory mechanisms and the biomolecules that control cardiovascular calcification overlap with those controlling skeletal mineralization. In this review, we focus on key biomolecules driving the ectopic calcification in the circulation and their regulation by metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory stimuli. Although calcium deposits in the vessel wall introduce rupture stress at their edges facing applied tensile stress, they simultaneously reduce rupture stress at the orthogonal edges, leaving the net risk of plaque rupture and consequent cardiac events depending on local material strength. A clinically important consequence of the shared mechanisms between the vascular and bone tissues is that therapeutic agents designed to inhibit vascular calcification may adversely affect skeletal mineralization and vice versa. Thus, it is essential to consider both systems when developing therapeutic strategies.",0

Patients with KS are usually diagnosed during childhood (early onset of the disease), and the major traits include abnormal calcification of cartilaginous tissues resulting in or associated with malformations of skeletal tissues (e.g., midface hypoplasia and brachytelephalangism) and cardiovascular defects (e.g., congenital heart defect, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, and, in some cases, arterial calcification), and also hearing loss and mild developmental delay. While studies on Mgp–/– mouse, a faithful model of KS, show that pathologic mineral deposition (ectopic calcification) in cartilaginous and vascular tissues is the primary cause underlying many of these abnormalities, the mechanisms explaining how MGP prevents abnormal calcification remain poorly understood. This has negative implication for the development of a cure for KS. Indeed, at present, only symptomatic treatments are available to treat hypertension and respiratory complications occurring in the KS patients. In this review, we summarize the results published in the last 50 years on Keutel syndrome and present the current status of the knowledge on this rare pathology.",0

This review synthesized online learning developments aimed at replacing previously face-to-face ‘classroom’ activities for postgraduate learners. Methods Four online databases (CINAHL, Embase, PsychINFO, and PubMed) and MedEdPublish were searched through 21 December 2020. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. The PICRAT technology integration framework was applied to examine how teachers integrated and learners engaged with technology. A descriptive synthesis and outcomes were reported. A thematic analysis explored limitations and lessons learned. Results Fifty-one publications were included. Fifteen collaborations were featured, including international partnerships and national networks of program directors. Thirty-nine developments described pivots of existing educational offerings online and twelve described new developments. Most interventions included synchronous activities (n Fif5). Virtual engagement was promoted through chat, virtual whiteboards, polling, and breakouts. Teacher’s use of technology largely replaced traditional practice. Student engagement was largely interactive. Underpinning theories were uncommon. Quality assessments revealed moderate to high risk of bias in study reporting and methodology. Forty-five developments assessed reaction; twenty-five attitudes, knowledge or skills; and two behavior. Outcomes were markedly positive. Eighteen publications reported social media or other outcomes, including reach, engagement, and participation. Limitations included loss of social interactions, lack of hands-on experiences, challenges with technology and issues with study design. Lessons learned highlighted the flexibility of online learning, as well as practical advice to optimize the online environment. Conclusions This review offers guidance to educators attempting to optimize learning in a post-pandemic world. Future developments would benefit from leveraging collaborations, considering technology integration frameworks, underpinning developments with theory, exploring additional outcomes, and designing and reporting developments in a manner that supports replication.",0

Method This qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted in June–August 2020. Interviews were analyzed via a two-phase Rapid Analysis. The study's primary outcomes (innovations in ED–PC during COVID) are published elsewhere. In this secondary analysis, we examine interviewee responses to broader questions about ED–PC currently and in the future. Results PC providers perceived as successful in their work in the ED were described as autonomous, competent, flexible, fast, and fluent in ED language and culture. Barriers to ED–PC integration included the ED environment, lack of access to PC providers at all times, the ED perception of PC, and the lack of a supporting financial model. Facilitators to ED–PC integration included proactive identification of patients who would benefit from PC, ED-focused PC education and tools, PC presence in the ED, and data supporting ED–PC. Increased primary PC education for ED staff, increased automation, and innovative ED–PC models were seen as areas for future growth. Significance of results Our findings provide useful information for PC programs considering expanding their ED presence, particularly as this is the first study to our knowledge that examines traits of successful PC providers in the ED environment. Our findings also suggest that, despite growth in the arena of ED–PC, barriers and facilitators remain similar to those identified previously. Future research is needed to evaluate the impact that ED–PC initiatives may have on patient and system outcomes, to identify a financial model to maintain ED–PC integration, and to examine whether perceptions of successful providers align with objective measures of the same.",0

WhatsApp instant messenger use is widely prevalent among health professionals, cancer patients, caregivers and the general population. It is a quick and easy communication tool that may also be used on personal computers and business purposes. WhatsApp instant messenger and other similar tools may be a very useful complement for e-medicine. Instant messaging systems may be helpful, especially in rural areas, in medium- or low-income countries, or to avoid unnecessary travels, improve knowledge and awareness of cancer, monitor home care and support the delivery of home care. The unregulated use of WhatsApp instant messenger requires sound and shared guidelines to assure impeccable professional service. Although a significant number of papers have investigated the roles of social networks in connecting patients to health professionals, there is still a lack of information and scientific data about their uses, benefits and limitations in connecting health providers only for professional communication.

However, palliative care knowledge in the general population is limited, and often physician referral occurs late in prognosis. The objective of this analysis was to examine factors associated with palliative care knowledge. Method: Using data from the 2018 NCI's Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5 Cycle 2, descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses, and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with respondents' palliative care knowledge using ORs and 95% confidence intervals as measures of association. The outcome of interest was measured with the item “How would you describe your level of knowledge about palliative care?” Possible response selections were “I've never heard of it,” “I know a little bit about palliative care,” and “I know what palliative care is and could explain it to someone else.” To reduce the risk of type 1 error, jackknife variance estimations with repeated replications were used. All analyses were conducted with the SURVEYLOGISTIC command using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.), and the statistical significance level was set at P < 0.05. Results: A total of 3,450 respondents (weighted sample size: 249,489,772) met the inclusion criteria. About 89% (n = 3,000) of all respondents had inadequate knowledge of palliative care. Multivariable analyses indicated that frequent health care utilization as defined as ≥ 2 times per year [OR, 3.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.65–3.58], female gender (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.31–3.59), being married (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.14–3.59), having a college degree or higher (OR, 13.83; 95% CI, 1.71–12.04), and having a regular source of care (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.37–1.90) had greater odds of adequate palliative care knowledge. Those without a cancer diagnosis were less likely to have adequate knowledge of palliative care (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41–0.89). Conclusions: Knowledge of palliative care in the United States is low, particularly for those not already actively using their available healthcare system. Public health education efforts are needed to target subgroups of the U.S. population identified by this analysis to increase palliative care knowledge. Impact: Healthcare providers have a major role to play in improving palliative care knowledge.",0

While several reviews have been conducted regarding technologies used during the COVID-19 pandemic, they were limited by focusing either on a specific technology (or features) or proposed rather than implemented technologies. Objective This review aims to provide an overview of technologies, as reported in the literature, implemented during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a scoping review using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) Extension for Scoping Reviews. Studies were retrieved by searching 8 electronic databases, checking the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews (backward reference list checking), and checking studies that cited included studies (forward reference list checking). The search terms were chosen based on the target intervention (ie, technologies) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). We included English publications that focused on technologies or digital tools implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide health-related services regardless of target health condition, user, or setting. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data from eligible papers. We used a narrative approach to synthesize extracted data. Results Of 7374 retrieved papers, 126 were deemed eligible. Telemedicine was the most common type of technology (107/126, 84.9%) implemented in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the most common mode of telemedicine was synchronous (100/108, 92.6%). The most common purpose of the technologies was providing consultation (75/126, 59.5%), followed by following up with patients (45/126, 35.7%), and monitoring their health status (22/126, 17.4%). Zoom (22/126, 17.5%) and WhatsApp (12/126, 9.5%) were the most commonly used videoconferencing and social media platforms, respectively. Both health care professionals and health consumers were the most common target users (103/126, 81.7%). The health condition most frequently targeted was COVID-19 (38/126, 30.2%), followed by any physical health conditions (21/126, 16.7%), and mental health conditions (13/126, 10.3%). Technologies were web-based in 84.1% of the studies (106/126). Technologies could be used through 11 modes, and the most common were mobile apps (86/126, 68.3%), desktop apps (73/126, 57.9%), telephone calls (49/126, 38.9%), and websites (45/126, 35.7%). Conclusions Technologies played a crucial role in mitigating the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We did not find papers describing the implementation of other technologies (eg, contact-tracing apps, drones, blockchain) during the first wave. Furthermore, technologies in this review were used for other purposes (eg, drugs and vaccines discovery, social distancing, and immunity passport). Future research on studies on these technologies and purposes is recommended, and further reviews are required to investigate technologies implemented in subsequent waves of the pandemic.",0

Palliative care consultation may benefit these patients and their families. Prior to the pandemic, our institution implemented a policy of automatic palliative care consultation for all patients on ECMO due to the high mortality, medical complexity, and psychosocial distress associated with these cases. Objectives: The main objective was to describe the role of the palliative care team for patients on ECMO for COVID-19 infection. The secondary objective was to describe the clinical outcomes for this cohort. Design: Case series. Settings/Subjects: All patients age 18 or older infected by the novel coronavirus who required cannulation on ECMO from March through July of 2020, at an urban, academic medical center in the United States. Inter-disciplinary palliative care consultation occurred for all patients. Results: Twenty-three patients (median age 43 years [range 28-64], mean body mass index 34.9 kg/m2 [SD 9.2], 65% Hispanic ethnicity) were cannulated on ECMO. Eleven patients died during the hospitalization (48%). Patients older than 50 years of age demonstrated a trend toward increased odds of death compared to those younger than 50 years of age (OR 9.1, P = 0.07). Patients received an average of 6.8 (SD 3.7) palliative clinical encounters across all disciplines. The actions provided by the palliative care team included psychosocial support and counseling, determination of surrogate decision maker (for 100% of patients), pain management (83%), and non-pain symptom management (83%). Conclusions: Here, we present one of the first studies describing the patient characteristics, outcomes, and palliative care actions for critically ill patients with COVID-19 on ECMO. Almost half of the patients in this cohort died during their hospitalization. Given the high morbidity and mortality of this condition, we recommend involvement of palliative care for patients/families with COVID-19 infection who are on ECMO. The impact of palliative care on patient and family outcomes, such as symptom control, satisfaction with communication, rates of anxiety, and grief experience merits further investigation.",0

The Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway is widely involved in inflammatory response and promotes the activation of nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, thus leading to pyroptosis and fibrosis. Curcumin is a natural compound with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. However, whether AFB1 exposure leads to the activation of the JAK2/NLRP3 signaling pathway in the liver and whether curcumin can regulate this pathway to influence pyroptosis and fibrosis in the liver remains unclear. In order to clarify these problems, we first treated ducklings with 0, 30, or 60 µg/kg AFB1 for 21 days. We found that AFB1 exposure caused growth inhibition, liver structural and functional damage, and activated JAK2/NLRP3-mediated liver pyroptosis and fibrosis in ducks. Secondly, ducklings were divided into a control group, 60 µg/kg AFB1 group, and 60 µg/kg AFB1 + 500 mg/kg curcumin group. We found that curcumin significantly inhibited the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as the occurrence of pyroptosis and fibrosis in AFB1-exposed duck livers.

To investigate the protective effects of Se on bone microenvironment (BM)-related hematopoiesis and immunity after T-2 toxin exposure, 36 male mice were treated with the T-2 toxin (1 mg/kg) and/or Se (0.2 mg/kg) by intragastric administration for 28 days. The results showed that Se alleviated T-2 toxin-induced cytopenia and splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis. Se also significantly relieved T-2 toxin-induced immunosuppression, as assessed by immune factors and lymphocytes. Furthermore, Se also attenuated oxidative stress and apoptosis and improved the BM in T-2 toxin-exposed mice. Therefore, Se improves BM-related hematopoiesis and immunity after T-2 toxin exposure. This study provides references for identifying the toxic mechanism and screening potential therapeutic drugs of the T-2 toxin.",0

DBP can also cause skeletal dysplasia, but it is unclear whether ROS is involved. In addition, overproduction of ROS can activate mitophagy, which is an important mechanism for regulating mitochondrial quality and cell homeostasis. In order to investigate whether DBP can damage MC3T3‐E1 cells (osteoblast cell line) and whether ROS and mitophagy are involved, DBP toxicity experiment, Parkin gene silencing experiment, and N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) intervention experiment were performed on MC3T3‐E1 cells in turn. First, we found that DBP caused MC3T3‐E1 cell viability decline and osteogenic dysfunction, accompanied by the overproduction of ROS and the activation of mitophagy. Then, we found that silencing Parkin expression alleviated DBP‐induced apoptosis and osteogenic dysfunction of MC3T3‐E1 cells. In addition, NAC treatment inhibited the PINK1/Parkin‐mediated mitophagy and alleviated the apoptosis and osteogenic dysfunction of MC3T3‐E1 cells caused by DBP.

Our research showed that T‐2 toxin caused bone formation disorders, presenting as the reduction of the BMD and femur length, bone structure changes and abnormal bone formation proteins expressions, along with enhanced oxidative stress. Meanwhile, T‐2 toxin increased expressions of autophagy‐related proteins (Beclin 1, ATG5, p62, and LC3), and promoted apoptosis in mouse femur. Moreover, T‐2 toxin suppressed the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling and expressions of downstream target genes. Taken together, our data indicated T‐2 toxin‐induced femur lesion was accompanied by autophagy and apoptosis, which was associated with Wnt/β‐catenin signaling.",0

However, its emissions to the atmosphere have gone largely unchecked because the microbial and environmental controls governing N2O emissions have proven difficult to manage. The microbial process N2O consumption is the only know biotic pathway to remove N2O from soil pores and therefore reduce N2O emissions. Consequently, manipulating soils to increase N2O consumption by organic carbon (OC) additions has steadily gained interest. However, the response of N2O emissions to different OC additions are inconsistent, and it is unclear if lower N2O emissions are due to increased consumption, decreased production, or both. Simplified and systematic studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of different OC additions on N2O consumption. We aimed to manipulate N2O consumption by amending soils with OC compounds (succinate, acetate, propionate) more directly available to denitrifiers. We hypothesized that N2O consumption is OC‐limited and predicted these denitrifier‐targeted additions would lead to enhanced N2O consumption and increased nosZ gene abundance. We incubated diverse soils in the laboratory and performed a 15N2O isotope pool dilution assay to disentangle microbial N2O emissions from consumption using laser‐based spectroscopy. We found that amending soils with OC increased gross N2O consumption in six of eight soils tested. Furthermore, three of eight soils showed Increased N2O Consumption and Decreased N2O Emissions (ICDE), a phenomenon we introduce in this study as an N2O management ideal. All three ICDE soils had low soil OC content, suggesting ICDE is a response to relaxed C‐limitation wherein C additions promote soil anoxia, consequently stimulating the reduction of N2O via denitrification. We suggest, generally, OC additions to low OC soils will reduce N2O emissions via ICDE. Future studies should prioritize methodical assessment of different, specific, OC‐additions to determine which additions show ICDE in different soils.",0

In this frame, the responses of mouse macrophages were studied. Both proteomic and targeted analyses were performed to investigate several parameters, such as phagocytic capacity, cytokine release, copper release, and response at sub toxic doses. Besides titanium dioxide and copper oxide nanoparticles, copper ions were used as controls. We also showed that the overall copper release in the cell does not explain per se the toxicity observed with copper oxide nanoparticles. In addition, both copper ion and copper oxide nanoparticles, but not titanium oxide, induced DNA strands breaks in macrophages. As to functional responses, the phagocytic capacity was not hampered by any of the treatments at non-toxic doses, while copper ion decreased the lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine and nitric oxide productions. The proteomic analyses highlighted very few changes induced by titanium dioxide nanoparticles, but an induction of heme oxygenase, an increase of glutathione synthesis and a decrease of tetrahydrobiopterin in response to copper oxide nanoparticles. Subsequent targeted analyses demonstrated that the increase in glutathione biosynthesis and the induction of heme oxygenase (e.g. by lovastatin/monacolin K) are critical for macrophages to survive a copper challenge, and that the intermediates of the catecholamine pathway induce a strong cross toxicity with copper oxide nanoparticles and copper ions.",0

In regions with high cadmium exposure in Japan, cadmium accumulation occurs primarily in the kidneys of individuals who are exposed to the metal. In contrast, in the itai-itai disease outbreak that occurred in the Jinzu River basin in Toyama Prefecture in Japan, cadmium primarily accumulated in the liver. On the other hand, high concentration of cadmium caused renal tubular disorder and osteomalacia (multiple bone fracture), probably resulting from the renal tubular dysfunction and additional pathology. In this study, we aimed to establish a mouse model of chronic cadmium intake. We administered cadmium-containing drinking water (32 mg/l) to female and male mice ad libitum for 11 weeks. Metal analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that cadmium accumulated in the kidneys (927 x 10 + 185 ng/g in females and 661 x 10 + 101 ng/g in males), liver (397 x 10 + 199 ng/g in females and 238 x 10 + 652 ng/g in males), and thyroid gland (293 + 93.7 ng/g in females and 129 + 72.7 ng/g in males) of mice. Female mice showed higher cadmium accumulation in the kidney, liver, and thyroid gland than males did (p = 0.00345, p = 0.00213, and p = 0.0331, respectively).

It has also been applied to address questions at different levels, from the search of the primary molecular targets of toxicants to the deciphering of the molecular responses of cells and tissues to toxicants. Although restricted to mammalian cells and tissues, this paper reviews these two levels of investigation and the different application areas of toxicoproteomics, leading to the discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of the most popular proteomic platforms. Some of the pending questions in toxicoproteomics are also critically addressed, such as the specificity, validation, and result hierarchization issues. The question of shared mechanisms, which are encountered in many toxicoproteomic papers dealing with different toxicants, is also discussed.

We investigated the effects of cadmium and lead on the viability of primary HRCE cells. A severe dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell viability was induced by either heavy metal. Cell mortality was due to apoptotic death, as demonstrated by a decrease of procaspase-9 and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 with consequent activation of caspase-3. By ICP-MS analyses we determined the amount of heavy metals in the intracellular compartment, which was found to be higher for lead than cadmium. To gain insights into the effects of heavy metals on the cell proteome, a systematic investigation was performed, based on 2D-PAGE, image analysis, protein identification and bioinformatics analyses. Among more than 300 protein spots visualized in bidimensional maps, 27 proteins were found to be altered in their expression levels following heavy metal exposure. These proteins were all identified by nanoLC-MS/MS. The majority of them were found to be involved in apoptotic pathways, protein folding or energetic metabolism, which eventually lead to cell death. Taking advantage of an integrated workflow, we identified specific protein targets of heavy metals, which represent a contribution to the identification of potential biomarkers of heavy metal environmental pollution.",0

The effect of cadmium intoxication on this regulatory system has been investigated in a cellular model of human epithelium. Cadmium exposure of HeLa cells did not activate the IRPs; rather, the amount of these proteins relative to that of housekeeping proteins decreased. Accordingly, the transferrin receptor mRNA level decreased upon cadmium insult. In a more integrated investigation, separate groups of mice had free access to different doses of cadmium in drinking water for 3 weeks. Cadmium accumulated in all analyzed organs, but its concentration in mouse tissues did not correlate with changes of the activity of the IRPs. The intoxicated mice did not show any sign of anemia, indicating that iron homeostasis was not immediately disrupted after the onset of cadmium accumulation. These data establish that cadmium destabilizes IRPs in mammalian cells, but that iron imbalance is not an early event of cadmium intoxication.",0

At THE SPARSE REPRESENTATION first, Southeastern Asia was unique in having provided remains from the Trinil beds in Java, but the signifi­ cance of this poorly preserved skull-cap was confirmed and greatly amplified by subsequent discoveries (Von Koenigswald 1940) of better preserved specimens at other localities of similar age, as well as in the still older Djetis beds. Still tfuly unique in all the world is the somewhat younger occupation site of Locality 1 Choukoutien, with its extraordinarily abundant, prob­ ably cannibalized, human remains in association with hearths, stone implements (Choukoutienian chopper/ chopping-tool complex), and remains of slaughtered animals. For many years, the only such find from the West was the enigmatic human mandible from the Grafenrain gravel pit at Mauer in the Rhineland. Then, within a few years in the mid-thirties, three additional speci­ mens came to light in western Europe (Steinheim), Britain (Swanscombe), and northwest Africa (Rabat, Morocco). In the last several years, further Middle Pleistocene human remains were found in northwest Africa, both in Algeria (Ternifine) and in Morocco (Sidi Abderrahman).

These human skeletal remains, taken in conjunction with those from the Middle Pleistocene of eastern and southern Asia, have an important bearing on interpre­ tations of the course of human evolution. The signifi­ cance of these discoveries has been obscured by the pre­ occupation of some human paleontologists with other human remains either suspected to be of Pleistocene antiquity or questionable due to an extraordinary com· plex of morphological features (the famous hoax of Piltdown). Largely as a consequence of this, there have grown up two main interpretations of man's phylogeny in the Pleistocene, one depending on the possible im­ portance of the suspicious fossils, and the other de­ pending only on the scanty, but well-dated, human fos­ sils enumerated above. The former interpretation recognizes an early, at least earlier, Middle Pleistocene separation of a morphologically modern (sapiens) lineage. The latter postulates progressive transforma· tion of primitive and variable Middle Pleistocene hu­ man populations into diverse Neanderthal and re­ lated, geographically distinctive, groups, as well as into incipiently sapiens peoples.

The occurrence of relatively archaic species together with more modern species in the Forest Bed fauna has puzzled many palaeontologists. Whereas the older authors concluded that it was wholly Pliocene (Reid, 1890, with bibliography) or partially or totally derived (Dubois, 1905), more recently a tendency has become prevalent to attribute the whole fauna to the early Pleistocene, and to explain the more archaic species as relics (Osborn, 1922; Zeuner, 1945). It may be shown that all these interpretations are untenable. A Pliocene age is ruled out by the presence of species which immigrated into Europe after the close of the Villafranchian. On the other hand, the older representatives, once attributed to the Pliocene but actually of Upper Villafranchian age, do not constitute isolated relics: an entire faunal assemblage characteristic of that epoch is present. Moreover, primitive species occur in the Forest Bed fauna together with their more advanced descendants, and the fauna is richer in species than in any other locality.",0

Boswell has studied the Pleistocene deposits of East Anglia and, from time to time, published most illuminating reviews summarising the progress of work and discussing the possible relations to the corresponding deposits of other districts (especially 1931, 1932, 1936). In his Presidential Address to the Prehistoric Society last year, he paid particular attention to a problem which has often been attacked but not yet solved satisfactorily, namely the correlation of East Anglia with the Continent; and he suggested, as a possible way out of the difficulties, the correlation of the Hunstanton Boulder Clay with Würm 2, the Upper Chalky Drift with Würm 1, the Great Chalky Boulder Clay with Riss, the North Sea Drift with Mindel, and the later Crag deposits containing a cold fauna, with Günz. He admitted, however, that such a correlation would ‘bring other difficulties in its train.’",0

 For fault failures of a steam turbine occur frequently and cause huge losses, it is important to identify the fault category. A steam turbine clustering fault diagnosis method based on t-distribution stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is proposed. Firstly, the t-SNE algorithm is used to map high-dimensional data to low-dimensional space, and data clustering is performed in low-dimensional space. Combined with the fault records of the power plant, the fault data and health data of the clustering result are distinguished. Then, the imbalance problem in the data is processed by the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm to obtain the steam turbine characteristic data set with fault labels. Finally, we used the XGBoost to solve this multiclassification problem. In the experiment, the method achieved the best performance with an overall accuracy of 97% and early warning at least two hours in advance. The experimental results show that this method can effectively evaluate the state and make fault warning for power plant equipment.",0

Cleaning bad data is thus necessary for the situational analysis of a data-based power system. Methods for the identification and modification of bad data based on state estimation may fail to converge in iterative calculations, and yield poor results when the errors are significant. State estimation also involves non-linear computation, which incurs a significant computational overhead and makes it difficult to efficiently handle large volumes of data. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a method for the detection and identification of bad data based on constraints on spatial–temporal correlation. In the spatial domain, we fix the equivalent power balance condition through the topology of the network. In sequential distribution, we establish data constraints based on the similarity of data among temporal sections. We then check the data in combination with the spatial–temporal correlation constraints. The proposed method was applied to an IEEE 14-bus system and a provincial grid, and the results show that it can reliably detect and modify bad data to significantly improve their quality. The proposed approach avoids non-linear calculations, is computationally efficient, and can quickly detect and modify bad data.",0

Although a previous study has shown that the DIWR processor achieves a significant speedup, power consumption has not been explored. The power consumption is increased in DIWR because the instruction window resources are enlarged in memoryintensive phases. If the power consumption exceeds the power budget determined by certain requirements, the DIWR processor must save power and thus, the performance previously presented cannot be achieved. In this paper, we explore to what extent the DIWR processor can achieve improved performance for a given power budget, assuming that dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is introduced as a power saving technique. Evaluation results using the SPEC2006 benchmark programs show that the DIWR processor, even with a constrained power budget, achieves a speedup over the conventional processor over a wide range of given power budgets. At the most important power budget point, i.e., when the power a conventional processor consumes without any power constraint is supplied, DIWR achieves a 16% speedup. key words: microprocessor, superscalar processor, memory-level parallelism, instruction-level parallelism, power consumption",0

Despite emphasizing customer involvement, in practice end users commonly do not participate in the early stages of these methods; instead, other business-related customers represent them in defining end-user needs. As a result, the produced software often does not satisfy the actual users’ needs, and the User Experience (UX) suffers. User-centered design, Design Thinking, and Lean Startup have been combined with agile methods to support defining the problem focused on user needs and producing effective software. Lean Inception (LI) represents a workshop that combines Design Thinking and Lean Startup. However, the effectiveness of problem definition and end-user participation in LIs is little explored. This paper presents a case study addressing this gap, investigating the use of LIs to define the problem and how the participation of end users in this context contributes to the resulting UX. We conducted ten semi-structured interviews with customers and end-users of an agile software project using LI. Our analysis suggests that, while LI supports the identification of business goals, more details about user needs and software requirements are needed to support designers and developers in understanding the problem and evaluating its feasibility. We also identified a mischaracterization of user journeys and personas in LIs due to the short time dedicated to their creation, hampering the discussion of relevant UX issues. Finally, we observed that, when end users were present in the early stages, they helped the development team to design software that fits into their routine, improving the UX and increasing its adoption. We qualitatively discuss these issues and gains of directly involving end users and not “proxy” stakeholders in LI’s.",0

We constructed two femur models with Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO) type A1 fractures using 3D computed tomography scans. The new and standard PFNA designs were inserted into the femur models and subsequently transferred to the program. We investigated the distribution of stress on the tip of the lag screw, the calcar region, lag screw-nail junction, and the additional screw inserted through the greater trochanter (only present in the new PFNA design) using 3D finite element analysis. Results When the von Mises stress distributions in our models were examined, the maximum stress at the lag screw-nail junction was 18 mpa in the new design PFNA, while it was 20 mpa in the classic PFNA model. The maximum stress at the junction of the additional screw that had greater trochanter inlet with the nail was found as 42.5 mpa. The maximum stress on the calcar region was found to be 10 mpa at the new design PFNA, while it was 13 mpa with 30% increase in the classic PFNA. The stress on the tip of the lag screw was found to be 49 mpa in the classic PFNA design, while in the new design PFNA it was found as 28 mpa with a decrease of more than 40%. Conclusion As per our findings, the new PFNA design leads to reduced stress on the lag screw-nail junction, the calcar region, and the tip of the lag screw.",0

In military aviation, although hypoxia-related fatalities are rare, incidences are common and are likely underreported. Hypoxia is a reduction in oxygen availability, which can impair brain function and performance of operational and safety-critical tasks. HH occurs at high altitude, due to the reduction in atmospheric oxygen pressure. This physiological state is also partially simulated in normobaric environments for training and research, by reducing the fraction of inspired oxygen to achieve comparable tissue oxygen saturation [normobaric hypoxia (NH)]. Hypoxia can occur in susceptible individuals below 10,000 ft (3,048 m) in unpressurised aircrafts and at higher altitudes in pressurised environments when life support systems malfunction or due to improper equipment use. Between 10,000 ft and 15,000 ft (4,572 m), brain function is mildly impaired and hypoxic symptoms are common, although both are often difficult to accurately quantify, which may partly be due to the effects of hypocapnia. Above 15,000 ft, brain function exponentially deteriorates with increasing altitude until loss of consciousness. The period of effective and safe performance of operational tasks following exposure to hypoxia is termed the time-of-useful-consciousness (TUC). Recovery of brain function following hypoxia may also lag beyond arterial reoxygenation and could be exacerbated by repeated hypoxic exposures or hyperoxic recovery. This review provides an overview of the basic physiology and implications of hypoxia for military aviation and discusses the utility of hypoxia recognition training.",0

Results: The presented findings from the literature review confirm rather large variations of pulse oximetry measures (SpO2 and HR) during acute exposure and acclimatization to high altitude, related to the varying conditions between studies mentioned above. It turned out that particularly SpO2 levels decrease with acute altitude/hypoxia exposure and partly recover during acclimatization, with an opposite trend of HR. Moreover, the development of acute mountain sickness (AMS) was consistently associated with lower SpO2 values compared to individuals free from AMS. Conclusions: The use of finger pulse oximetry at high altitude is considered as a valuable tool in the evaluation of individual acclimatization to high altitude but also to monitor AMS progression and treatment efficacy.",0

The reason for this intersubject-variability of the responses is still not completely understood. This study is performed with 32 healthy subjects, using the systemic physiology augmented functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SPA-fNIRS) approach. We investigate the intersubject variability of hemodynamic and systemic physiological responses, due to a verbal fluency task (VFT) under colored light exposure (CLE; blue and red). Five and seven different hemodynamic response patterns were detected in the subgroup analysis of the blue and red light exposure, respectively. We also found that arterial oxygen saturation and mean arterial pressure were positively correlated with [O2Hb] at the prefrontal cortex during the CLE-VFT independent of the color of light and classification of the subjects. Our study finds that there is substantial intersubject-variability of cerebral hemodynamic responses, which is partially explained by subject-specific systemic physiological changes induced by the CLE-VFT. This means that both subgroup analyses and the additional assessment of systemic physiology are of crucial importance to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the effects of a CLE-VFT on human subjects.",0

The pairing—dubbed happy hypoxia but more precisely termed silent hypoxemia—is especially bewildering to physicians and is considered as defying basic biology. This combination has attracted extensive coverage in media but has not been discussed in medical journals. It is possible that coronavirus has an idiosyncratic action on receptors involved in chemosensitivity to oxygen, but well-established pathophysiological mechanisms can account for most, if not all, cases of silent hypoxemia. These mechanisms include the way dyspnea and the respiratory centers respond to low levels of oxygen, the way the prevailing carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) blunts the brain’s response to hypoxia, effects of disease and age on control of breathing, inaccuracy of pulse oximetry at low oxygen saturations, and temperature-induced shifts in the oxygen dissociation curve. Without knowledge of these mechanisms, physicians caring for patients with hypoxemia free of dyspnea are operating in the dark, placing vulnerable patients with COVID-19 at considerable risk. In conclusion, features of COVID-19 that physicians find baffling become less strange when viewed in light of long-established principles of respiratory physiology; an understanding of these mechanisms will enhance patient care if the much-anticipated second wave emerges.",0

Indeed, they allow the treatment of water, preservation of food products, production of bioactive compounds, extraction of organic acids, and recovery of energy from natural and wastewaters without major environmental impact. Hence, the aim of the present review is to give a global portrait of the most recent developments in electrodialytic membrane phenomena and their uses in sustainable strategies. It has appeared that new knowledge on pulsed electric fields, electroconvective vortices, overlimiting conditions and reversal modes as well as recent demonstrations of their applications are currently boosting the interest for electrodialytic processes. However, the hurdles are still high when dealing with scale-ups and real-life conditions. Furthermore, looking at the recent research trends, potable water and wastewater treatment as well as the production of value-added bioactive products in a circular economy will probably be the main applications to be developed and improved. All these processes, taking into account their principles and specificities, can be used for specific eco-efficient applications. However, to prove the sustainability of such process strategies, more life cycle assessments will be necessary to convince people of the merits of coupling these technologies.",0

The consensus and ancestral sequence-based immunogens minimize the genetic distance between contemporary isolates and vaccine strains. Hence these sequences may be promising candidates for HIV vaccines or serve as a universal reagent set for evaluating Gag-specific responses. Methods:In this study, we measured the T-cell reactivity to consensus (subtype A, B, C and group M), ancestral (group M and subtype B) and HXB2 Gag peptides (15-mers overlapping by 11) in HIV-1-infected subjects from two reference populations. We evaluated the Gag-specific T-cell responses in 43 chronically infected US (subtype B) and 13 Zambian (subtype C) subjects using an interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. Results:Our findings demonstrate a broad cross-reactivity of nearly 70% among all the seven Gag immunogens evaluated. Consensus M sequences elicited similar levels of responses as did the consensus B, ancestral subtype B and HXB2 peptides in subtype B-infected US patients. In subtype C-infected Zambian subjects, responses of similar breadth and magnitude were elicited by consensus C, consensus M and ancestral M peptides. Conclusion:Our data demonstrate that peptide pools based on consensus or ancestral M-based sequences can be used to evaluate Gag-specific responses elicited by subtype B or subtype C-based immunogens.",0

MethodsAnti-HIV-peptide antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. Induction of cellulary responses was assessed by proliferative test and 51Cr-release assay. ResultsLocal and systemic adverse reactions were always mild or moderate. After three injections an antibody response was detected in 25 out of 28 volunteers (89%). T cells from 19 (79%) of the 24 volunteers proliferated in response to at least one peptide. The majority of the volunteers had induced a multispecific proliferative response; that is, cells from volunteers proliferated to two (five of 19), three (five of 19), four (three of 19) or five peptides (one of 19). Cytotoxic responses by anti-HIV CD8+ lymphocytes could be tested in 24 volunteers, 13 (54%) of whom had clear and reproducible responses, with strong activity in the remaining 12 (> 20% of specific lysis), and polyepitopic responses were detected in at least seven of the 13 responders. Cytotoxic responses were found against the whole NEF protein (clade B LAI) in three of four tested volunteers and cross-reactions with the proteins of clade B (MN) and clade A (Bangui) HIV-1 strains, and also HIV-2 ROD, were detected in one of two tested volunteers.

Mathematical analyses of results from EIAs with singly substituted V3 peptides revealed important residues determining overall N-terminal V3 peptide antigenicity. This information was used to design V3 immunogens, rabbit antiserum to which were tested in EIA and for in vitro neutralization of molecular clones of HIV-1(MN) and HIV-1(MAL). Intersubtype-reactive epitopes were distributed toward the N-terminal half of the V3 loop. Lysine at position 310, arginine at position 311, and isoleucine at position 314, all derived from the MN primary sequence, were major determinants of intersubtype V3 antigenicity. Combinations of residues that enhanced antigenicity often contained lysine at position 310. Threonine at position 308 was common in the least advantageous combinations. V3 immunogens modified to achieve optimal antigenicity induced antiserum with augmented cross-neutralization of virus from MAL and MN molecular clones, suggesting one approach to subunit vaccine development.",0

The 18–20 mer peptides comprised residues 299–317 (numbering of HIV1 MN) in the N‐terminal half of the V3 loop of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and were derived from the sequences of autologous, as well as heterologous isolates. All four individuals studied lacked anti‐V3 IgG binding to at least one autologous V3 sequence. V3 peptides to which autologous sera lacked binding IgG were all immunogenic in rabbits and induced antisera that were broadly cross‐reactive by EIA and broadly cross‐neutralising to primary HIV‐1 isolates. This indicates that the peptides are immunogenic per se and that the respective human hosts have selective defects in recognising the corresponding V3 sequences. Despite the absence of antibody binding to autologous V3 peptides, the human sera had neutralising antibodies to autologous (three out of four cases), as well as heterologous isolates (all cases). Moreover, in vitro exposure of the patients' isolates to autologous neutralising serum or the homologous rabbit antiserum selected for variants with amino acid substitutions close to the crown of the V3 loop or in regions outside the sequence corresponding to peptides used for immunisation. The amino acid exchanges affected V3 positions known to be antigenic and which are also prone to change successively in infected persons. It is likely that neutralising antibodies recognise both linear and conformational epitopes in the V3 loop. Apparently, there are several, but restricted, numbers of ways for this structure to change its conformation and thereby give rise to neutralisation resistant viruses. J. Med.

Two chimpanzees immunized with the recombinant canarypox virus ALVAC-HIV (vCP125) expressing gp160MN and boosted with purified gp160MN/LAI alone, then with both immunogens in combination, were not protected against challenge with HIV-1 SF2. Their sera mainly recognized one epitope of the V3 loop, located in the NH2-terminal half. By contrast, immunization of two other chimpanzees with purified gp160MN/LAI and boosting with a synthetic V3MN peptide elicited a strong anti-V3 antibody response with a broader specificity directed against multiple epitopes all along the V3 loop. These chimpanzees were protected against infection by HIV-1 SF2. However, when these two chimpanzees were challenged later with a HIV-1 clade E strain virus, they became infected. We failed to detect any reactivity with the peptide of the ectodomain of gp41 of sera harvested after immunization with the various immunogens or after challenge with HIV-1 SF2 or HIV-1 90CR402. These results demonstrated that anti-V3 antibodies with a restricted fine specificity were induced in chimpanzees immunized with gp160 purified or expressed by recombinant canarypox confirming our previous results obtained in three different species (human, guinea pig and, macaque). In contrast, a boost with the V3 peptide broadened antibody responses, suggesting that the mode of presentation of the V3 loop to the immune system strongly influences the epitope specificity of the resulting antibody response.",0

SiC materials can be processed in various forms, from nanomaterials to continuous fibers. Common applications of SiC materials include the aerospace and nuclear fields, where the material is used in severely oxidative environments. Therefore, it is important to understand the kinetics of SiC oxidation and the parameters influencing them. The first part of this review focuses on the oxidation of SiC in dry air according to the Deal and Grove model showing that the oxidation behavior of SiC depends on the temperature and the time of oxidation. The oxidation rate can also be accelerated with the presence of H2O in the system due to its diffusion through the oxide scales. Therefore, wet oxidation is studied in the second part. The third part details the effect of hydrothermal media on the SiC materials that has been explained by different models, namely Yoshimura (1986), Hirayama (1989) and Allongue (1992). The last part of this review focuses on the hydrothermal corrosion of SiC materials from an application point of view and determine whether it is beneficial (manufacturing of materials) or detrimental (use of SiC in latest nuclear reactors).",0

The role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in neuroendocrine tumors still needs to be further investigated. Methods: This study investigated the antitumor activity of the porcupine (PORCN) inhibitor WNT974 and the β-catenin inhibitor PRI-724 in human neuroendocrine tumor (NET) cell lines BON1, QGP-1, and NCI-H727 in vitro. NET cells were treated with WNT974, PRI-724, or small interfering ribonucleic acids against β-catenin, and subsequent analyses included cell viability assays, flow cytometric cell cycle analysis, caspase3/7 assays and Western blot analysis. Results: Treatment of NET cells with WNT974 significantly reduced NET cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner by inducing NET cell cycle arrest at the G1 and G2/M phases without inducing apoptosis. WNT974 primarily blocked Wnt/β-catenin signaling by the dose- and time-dependent downregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) phosphorylation and non-phosphorylated β-catenin and total β-catenin, as well as the genes targeting the latter (c-Myc and cyclinD1). Furthermore, the WNT974-induced reduction of NET cell viability occurred through the inhibition of GSK-3-dependent or independent signaling (including pAKT/mTOR, pEGFR and pIGFR signaling). Similarly, treatment of NET cells with the β-catenin inhibitor PRI-724 caused significant growth inhibition, while the knockdown of β-catenin expression by siRNA reduced NET tumor cell viability of BON1 cells but not of NCI-H727 cells. Conclusions: The PORCN inhibitor WNT974 possesses antitumor properties in NET cell lines by inhibiting Wnt and related signaling. In addition, the β-catenin inhibitor PRI-724 possesses antitumor properties in NET cell lines. Future studies are needed to determine the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in NET as a potential therapeutic target.",0

Based on bone densitometric measurements, weight loss induced by dietary restriction is known to be accompanied by reduced areal bone mineral density, bone mass, and/or bone size, and it is considered harmful to bone health. However, because of technological advancements in bone densitometric instruments (e.g., high‐resolution X‐ray tomography), dietary restrictions have been found to cause a reduction in bone mass/size rather than volumetric bone mineral density. Furthermore, when considering bone quality, bone health consists of diverse indices that cannot be fully represented by densitometric measurements alone. Indeed, there is evidence that moderate dietary restrictions do not impair intrinsic bone material properties, despite the reduction in whole‐bone strength because of a smaller bone size. In the present review, we integrate research evidence from traditional densitometric measurements, metabolic status assays (e.g., energy metabolism, oxidative stresses, and inflammatory responses), and biomaterial analyses to provide revised conclusions regarding the effects of CR, PR, and MR on the skeleton.",0

Athletes were divided into five specific exercise loading groups according to sport-specific training history: high-impact (triple jumpers and high jumpers), odd-impact (soccer players and squash players), high-magnitude (power lifters), repetitive impact (endurance runners), and repetitive non-impact (swimmers). TBS-values were determined from lumbar vertebral L1-L4 DXA images.

The principal histopathologic finding in this disease is endolymphatic hydrops. The majority of radiologic and histopathologic studies demonstrated a narrow vestibular aqueduct in Ménière's disease. There is no study in the literature investigating the relationship between inner ear pressure and vestibular aqueduct dimensions. Static acoustic compliance is a noninvasive procedure that is thought to measure perilymphatic pressure at the footplate. An increase in mechanical fluid pressure in the inner ear is transmitted to the footplate of the stapes. This causes a reduction in the compliance at the drum. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between vestibular aqueduct dimensions and static acoustic compliance in Ménière's disease and the normal population.,0

The solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is a common radiologic abnormality often detected incidentally. The majority of SPNs represent benign processes, including granulotmatous inflammation, bronchogenic cysts and hamartomata. However, a solitary nodule may also potentially represent an early stage of lung cancer or a metastasis. Diagnostic procedures such as percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy can exclude malignancy in a majority of cases and may eliminate the need for more invasive surgical procedure. Correlation of the findings on the FNAB with radiologic features is helpful in establishing the benignity.


CASES
We report the cytologic features of 6 cases of benign SPN: exogenous lipid pneumonia, sclerosing hemangioma, hemartoma, bronchogenic cyst, fungal granuloma and solitary fibrous tumor. We provide radiologic correlation for each entity and discuss the diagnostic pitfalls.


CONCLUSION
Cytologically, lack of nuclear atypia with bland chromatin is useful in separating benign from malignant SPN. Radiologically, smaller lesions with smooth, well-defined margins and calcifications are more likely to be benign. Our cases illustrate the cytologic and immunohistochemical features that can help to make a more precise diagnosis. The identification of these features, when correlated with imaging findings, allows the cytopathologist to better approach the SPN.",0

Initially described as a pleural tumor, solitaryfibrous tumor of the parotid gland (SFT) is rare and has been reported at a wide range ofanatomic sites. Although cases of SFT arising in the parotid gland have been previously described, a review of the literature failed to reveal cytology-based reports of this entity.


CASE
A 42-year-old man presented with a right parotid mass that had gradually enlarged over 3 years. He was otherwise asymptomatic. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the mass showed a hypercellular smear composed of spindle cells in both clusters and isolated forms, with ovoid nuclei, evenly distributed chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant to moderate cytoplasm with focally wispy, collagenous, intercellular material. The background was hemorrhagic, without chondromyxoid matrix or inflammatory cells. There was no evidence of a myoepithelial component. A diagnosis of spindle cell neoplasm was rendered. Histologic examination of the total parotidectomy specimen revealed a SFT arising in the parotid gland. The diagnosis was supported by immunohistochemical studies.


CONCLUSION
SFT is a well-circumscribed neoplasm composed of short, spindled, plump cells with scanty cytoplasm growing in a haphazard or ""patternless"" pattern. Tumor cells are intimately admixed with collagenous stroma. Hemangiopericytomalike vessels are frequently seen. Although SFT rarely occurs in the salivary gland and a definitive diagnosis based on cytologic preparations alone is difficult, the diagnosis of SFT can be considered when cytologic examination reveals a hypercellular smear composed of isolated, cohesive clusters of spindled, fibroblastlike cells associated with a collagenous component in ahemorrhagic background. The preoperative magnetic esonance image findings of a highly vascular neoplasm support the diagnosis.",0

To ascertain the cytologic characteristics of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura (SFTPs) on smear preparations.


STUDY DESIGN
Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was initially attempted preoperatively in five cases, but the specimens were inappropriate for interpretation because only a few tumor cells were obtained. Therefore, scratch smears made at the time of operation were used. Papanicolaou and immunocytochemical staining was performed in all 10 cases, 2 of which were malignant.


RESULTS
As expected, cellular tumors yielded more cells. The cytologic appearance was variable, showing spindle/bipolar, dendritic/stellate and intermediate cells. Atypical cells reminiscent of sarcoma were also present in cellular, benign tumors. Highly atypical epithelioid cells were obtained in two malignant cases. Immunocytochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CD34 and vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, regardless of histologic differences and cell shape.


CONCLUSION
It seems difficult to diagnose SFTPs with certainty by FNAC, partly because the cell morphology of SFTPs resembles a wide variety of heterogeneous groups of spindle cell tumors and partly because only a few tumor cells were available in the FNAC specimens in the present study. However, a cytologic diagnosis of SFTP is possible if cytologic preparations yield CD34-positive cells with spindle/bipolar or dendritic/stellate morphology.",0

Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare spindle cell tumor and has been forced at a variety of sites. To the best of our knowledge, only two cases of solitary fibrous tumor arising in the spinal cord have been reported; no cytologic findings were documented.


CASE
A 62-year-old male presented with a spinal cord tumor. A scrape smear of the resected tumor revealed naked, spindle-shaped nuclei. Some nuclei were twisted or had long spindles. In the background, abundant, thin and thick collagen fibers were present. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and negative for S-100 protein and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Histologic diagnosis of the tumor was benign solitary fibrous tumor.


CONCLUSION
Our case indicates that solitary fibrous tumor can occur in the spinal cord and should be differentiated from other benign spindle cell tumors, such as meningioma and schwannoma. The key cytologic features of solitary fibrous tumor may be the presence of abundant thin and thick collagen fibers in scrape specimens.",0

Among genes identified as differentially methylated between the breast cancer tissue of cases and controls, one of them, PRKACA, was also reported as differentially expressed in two studies included in the review. Although included studies were heterogeneous in terms of methodology and study population, our review suggests that genes of the PI3K pathway may play an important role in developing resistance to anti-HER2 agents in breast cancer patients.

ELMO1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers. However, the distinct function of ELMO1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear. We determined whether ELMO1 affects the oncogenic behavior of CRC cells and investigated its prognostic value in CRC patients. Materials and Methods: We investigated the impact of ELMO1 on tumor cell behavior using small interference RNA (siRNA) in CRC cell lines, including SW480 and DLD1. The expression of ELMO1 was investigated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in cancer tissues and sera obtained from CRC patients. Results: ELMO1 knockdown suppressed tumor cell proliferation in SW480 and DLD1 cells. ELMO1 knockdown-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of caspase-3, −7, and PARP activities and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein. ELMO1 knockdown-induced cell-cycle arrest by decreasing cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, 4 and 6, and the 25C cell division cycle (CDC25C). ELMO1 knockdown suppressed tumor cell invasion and migration. The expression of E-cadherin was increased, while that of Vimentin and Claudin 1 decreased following ELMO1 knockdown. The phosphorylation levels of PDK1, Akt, and GSK-3β and were down-regulated after ELMO1 knockdown. The expression of ELMO1 was found up-regulated in cancer tissues and sera taken from CRC patients. ELMO1 expression was significantly associated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastases, and poor survival. Conclusion: ELMO1 mediates tumor progression by increasing tumor cell motility and inhibiting apoptosis in human CRC.",0

We aimed to find a drug able to boost blood–brain barrier (BBB) properties and prevent BC cells (BCCs) extravasation, among PI3K, HSP90, and EGFR inhibitors and approved drugs. We used BCCs (4T1) and BBB endothelial cells (b.End5) to identify molecules with toxicity to 4T1 cells and safe for b.End5 cells. Moreover, we used those cells in mixed cultures to perform a high-throughput microscopy screening of drugs’ ability to ameliorate BBB properties and prevent BCCs adhesion and migration across the endothelium, as well as to analyse miRNAs expression and release profiles. KW-2478, buparlisib, and minocycline hydrochloride (MH) promoted maximal expression of the junctional protein β-catenin and induced 4T1 cells nucleus changes. Buparlisib and MH further decreased 4T1 adhesion. MH was the most promising in preventing 4T1 migration and BBB disruption, tumour and endothelial cytoskeleton-associated proteins modifications, and miRNA deregulation. Our data revealed MH’s ability to improve BBB properties, while compromising BCCs viability and interaction with BBB endothelial cells, besides restoring miRNAs’ homeostasis, paving the way for MH repurposing for BCBM prevention.",0

The Rho GTPases RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 are the primary drivers in the dynamic reorganisation process, leading to the development of filopodia and lamellipodia which dramatically increase platelet surface area upon activation. Rho GTPases cycle between their active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states through tightly regulated processes, central to which are the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). GEFs catalyse the dissociation of GDP by inducing changes in the nucleotide binding site, facilitating GTP binding and activating Rho GTPases. By contrast, while all GTPases possess intrinsic hydrolysing activity, this reaction is extremely slow. Therefore, GAPs catalyse the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, reverting Rho GTPases to their inactive state. Our current knowledge of these proteins is constantly being updated but there is considerably less known about the functionality of Rho GTPase specific GAPs and GEFs in platelets. In the present review, we discuss GAP and GEF proteins for Rho GTPases identified in platelets, their regulation, biological function and present a case for their further study in platelets.",0

We sought to investigate the potential association of DOCK1 with neurological deficits and outcomes in patients with spontaneous ICH. Methods Identification of methylation-regulated differentially expressed genes (MeDEGs) between ICH patients and matched controls was performed by analyzing the raw data from the GSE179759 and GSE125512 datasets deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus. A total of 114 patients who were admitted to our hospital for spontaneous ICH were retrospectively analyzed, with 108 healthy volunteers who had received physical examinations at the same period as controls. The mRNA expression of DOCK1 was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The hematoma volume was calculated according to the Coniglobus formula. The severity of neurological deficits was evaluated using National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and function outcomes were evaluated by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. Results A total of 15 MeDEGs between ICH patients and matched controls were identified. The mRNA expression of DOCK1 was remarkably higher in the serum samples of patients with spontaneous ICH than in the healthy controls. According to hematoma volume after ICH attack, small (<10 mL), medium (10 to 30 mL), and large (>30 mL) groups were arranged. The proportions of male patients and patients aged ≥60 years were significantly higher in the large group than in the small and medium groups (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of DOCK1 was significantly higher in the large group than in the small and medium groups (P < 0.05). According to NIHSS scores, mild (NIHSS scores ≤15), moderate (NIHSS scores from 16 to 30), and severe (NIHSS scores from 31 to 45) groups were classified. It was observed that the severe group had higher proportions of male patients and patients aged ≥60 years than the mild and moderate groups (P < 0.05). The severe group exhibited a higher mRNA expression of DOCK1 than the mild and moderate groups (P < 0.05). According to mRS scores, higher proportions of male patients and patients aged ≥60 years were observed in the unfavorable group than the favorable group (P < 0.05). The patients in the unfavorable group showed an elevated DOCK1 mRNA expression compared to those in the favorable group (P < 0.05). Conclusion The study provided evidence that male gender, older age, and higher DOCK1 mRNA expression were related to higher admission hematoma volume, neurologic deterioration, and poor function outcomes in patients with spontaneous ICH.",0

Afzelin is a chemical compound with anti-metastatic potentials. This study aimed to predict proteins involved in TNBC cell migration which could be inhibited by afzelin. Methods: The protein database was constructed from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways collection which related to cell motility, then screened for druggability using SuperTarget and Therapeutic Target Database. The involvement of druggable proteins in the TNBC metastasis process was investigated through existing publications in The National Center for Biotechnology Information PubMed database. Inhibitory potential of afzelin toward target proteins was compared to the proteins’ known-inhibitor, using the reverse docking method. Results: Ten proteins identified as potential targets of afzelin, with the top 3 being ERK2, KRas, and FAK, respectively. Afzelin's 3-O-rhamnoside group played a dominant role in forming hydrogen bonds with the target proteins. Further analysis with STRING suggested that afzelin might be able to inhibit chemotaxis and haptotaxis of TNBC cells. Conclusions: Afzelin was predicted to inhibit TNBC cell motility, by targeting ERK2, KRas, and FAK activation.",0

In terms of cancer‐related death, colon cancer ranks second and third among men and women, respectively, and the incidence is increasing annually. Accumulating evidence have indicated that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that lncRNA EPB41L4A‐AS1 was highly expressed in CRC tissues and was associated with poor prognosis and tumor metastasis in patients with CRC. In vitro studies showed that the knockdown of EPB41L4A‐AS1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition of CRC cells. Mechanically, we found that EPB41L4A‐AS1 may participate in the development of CRC by activating the Rho/Rho‐associated protein kinase signaling pathway. Collectively, these results demonstrated that EPB41L4A‐AS1 can promote the proliferation, invasion, and migration of CRC, and it may be a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and targeted treatment of CRC.",0

Dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (DOCK1), the first member of the DOCK family to be discovered, displays various roles during tumorigenesis; however, its role during RCC progression is not completely understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to clarify the function of DOCK1 and 1-[2-(3′-(trifluoromethyl)-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4-yl)-2-oxoethyl]-5-pyrrolidinylsulfonyl-2 (1H)-pyridone (TBOPP), a DOCK1-sensitive inhibitor, during RCC development and chemoresistance. The results of CCK-8 and EdU assay indicated that TBOPP decreased RCC cell viability and proliferation compared with the control group, and sensitized RCC cells to cisplatin. Moreover, RCC cells with high DOCK1 expression levels displayed increased resistance to cisplatin, whereas DOCK1 knockdown enhanced the lethal effects of cisplatin on RCC cells. Furthermore, the results determined by western blotting, CCK-8 and cell apoptosis assay indicated that TBOPP effectively reduced DOCK1 expression levels compared with the control group, and the TBOPP-mediated cisplatin sensitizing effect was mediated by DOCK1 inhibition. The present study suggests that DOCK1 plays a vital role in RCC cell chemoresistance to cisplatin; therefore, TBOPP may serve as a novel therapeutic agent for RCC chemoresistance.",0

Early detection of HCC could largely reduce mortalities. Ultrasonography (US) and serum Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP) test are the screening methods that are most frequently applied to high-risk populations. Due to the poor performance of AFP testing, and the highly operator-dependent nature of US, a biomarker for HCC early diagnosis is highly sought after. We developed a method for HCC screening using a 22-gene expression signature. Methods Peripheral whole blood of 98 patients were processed through microarrays for the first round of feature selection via two strategies, Minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM). Candidate genes were combined for further validation through qPCR in an enlarged population with 316 samples with 104 chronic hepatitis, 112 liver cirrhosis (LC), and 100 HCC. Results A 22-gene signature was established in classifying HCC and non-cancer samples with good performance. The area under curve reached 0.94 in all of the samples and 0.93 in the AFP -negative samples. Conclusions We have established a blood mRNA signature with high performance for HCC screening. Our results show transcriptome of peripheral blood could be valuable source for biomarkers.",0

Engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) protein has been implicated in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, cell migration, neurite outgrowth, cancer cell invasion and metastasis, and poor prognosis in various cancers. We investigated the role of ELMO1 in mediating the oncogenic behavior of gastric cancer (GC) cells. We also investigated the correlation between expression of ELMO1 in GC tissues and various clinicopathological parameters.


METHODS
We studied the impact of ELMO1 on tumor cell behavior using the pcDNA-myc vector and small interfering RNA in AGS and SNU1750 GC cell lines. We performed western blotting and immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of ELMO1 in GC cells and tissues.


RESULTS
ELMO1 overexpression inhibited apoptosis via the modulation of PARP, caspase-3 and caspase-7 in GC cells. ELMO1 overexpression led to significant increase in the number of migrating and invading GC cells. The expression of E-cadherin decreased and that of Snail increased in GC cells upon ELMO1 overexpression. Phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and GSK-3β was increased and that of β-catenin was decreased upon ELMO1 overexpression in GC cells. These results were reversed after ELMO1 knockdown. ELMO1 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, cancer stage, lymph node metastasis and survival. ELMO1-positive tumors had significantly higher mean of Ki-67 labeling index than ELMO1-negative tumors. There was no significant relationship between ELMO1 expression and the mean value of the apoptotic index.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that ELMO1 promotes tumor progression by modulating tumor cell survival in human GC.",0

Whether the apoptotic cells can be promptly removed is related to the occurrence and course of asthma. In recent years, studies have shown that Rac1 is involved in many cellular biological activities including the formation and elimination of apoptotic cells. In this study, based on the analysis of airway local cells and related factors in asthmatic mice, we evaluated the expression of Rac1 in airway epithelial cells or phagocytes and analysed its relationship with the incidence of apoptosis or scavenging of apoptotic cells. Our data showed that the expression level of Rac1 in asthmatic mice decreased significantly, while the expression of IL‐33 increased obviously. The airway epithelial cell line was stimulated by curcumin at 50 μmol/L for 24‐48 hours; more than 50% of the cells were apoptotic, and of which, about 20% were late apoptosis. Rac1 inhibitor (NSC23766) can enhance the apoptosis effect. In addition, the ability of phagocytosis and migration in the epithelial cells or macrophages was increased following the application of Rac1 inhibitors or specific siRNA in a dose‐dependent manner, and the expression level of IL‐33 was simultaneously increased after blocking Rac1. It is suggested that the down regulation of Rac1 in asthma may contribute to the apoptosis of airway epithelial cells and affect the clearance of apoptotic cells, which will lead to the aggregation of the apoptotic cells in the respiratory tract and participate in AHR.",0

Women tend to consider less important those aspects of democracy that privilege male resources and power, such as representative institutions, political parties, and the media. Instead, women assign more importance to those aspects of democracy that are less prone to reproduce gender inequalities, such as those related to direct participation (i.e., referenda), public justification of government decisions, and the protection of social rights. These differences are small in size but are comparable to the effects of other individual-level characteristics such as income or education. Finally, gendered differences in conceptions of democracy are not associated with different levels of democratic support. Men and women are most supportive of democracy where they are able to develop differentiated views about which aspects of democracy are most important for them.",0

This initial presentation has been attributed to cerebral hypoperfusion in the acute phase, and we investigated the impact of moderate hypothermia on the early changes in perfusion and metabolism following massive experimental SAH. SAH was induced in 61 anesthetized rats by rapid injection of 0.5 mL of arterial blood into the cisterna magna. In normothermia (NT), animals were kept at 37 degrees C, while in the primary hypothermia (pHT) group, temperature was lowered to 32 degrees C prior to SAH, and in the secondary hypothermia (sHT) group, cooling was started immediately after SAH. From 30 min prior to 180 min after SAH, Laser-Doppler-flowmetry (LDF) probes allowed online recording of cerebral blood flow (CBF) while parenchymal dialysate was collected by microdialysis probes within the frontoparietal cortex. In NT, the acute phase was characterized by impaired autoregulation and prolonged hypoperfusion. In pHT and sHT, autoregulation was preserved and acute hypoperfusion rapidly improved. SAH also caused a highly significant reduction in glucose in NT only. pHT significantly reduced accumulation of lactate, glutamate, and aspartate. Comparable trends were present for histidine, GABA, and taurine, while glutamine consumption was ameliorated. Early perfusion deficits caused by acute hypoperfusion and disruption of cerebral autoregulation can be ameliorated by hypothermia. Also, the acute phase of experimental SAH is characterized by glucose depletion, lactate accumulation, and release of excitatory amino acids, which can be influenced favorably by hypothermia.",0

A successful DoS attack on network resources reduces availability of service to a web site and backend resources, and could easily result in a loss of millions of dollars in revenue depending on company size. There are many DoS attack methods, each of which is critical to providing an understanding of the nature of the DoS attack class. There has been a rise in recent years of application-layer DoS attack methods that target web servers and are challenging to detect. An attack may be disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets or functions. Slow Read DoS attack is one type of slow HTTP attack targeting the application-layer. Slow Read attacks are often used to exploit weaknesses in the HTTP protocol, as it is the most widely used protocol on the Internet. In this paper, we use Full Packet Capture (FPC) datasets for detecting Slow Read DoS attacks with machine learning methods. All data collected originates in a live network environment. Our approach produces FPC features taken from network packets at the IP and TCP layers. Experimental results show that the machine learners were quite successful in identifying the Slow Read attacks with high detection and low false alarm rates using FPC data. Our experiment evaluates FPC datasets to determine the accuracy and efficiency of several detection models for Slow Read attacks. The experiment demonstrates that FPC features are discriminative enough to detect such attacks.",0

All US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for Tourette syndrome are antipsychotics, and their use is limited by the risk of weight gain, metabolic changes, and drug-induced movement disorders. Several small trials suggest that ecopipam, a first-in-class, selective dopamine 1 receptor antagonist, reduces tics with a low risk for these adverse events. This trial sought to further evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ecopipam in children and adolescents with moderate to severe Tourette syndrome.


METHODS
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial. Subjects aged ≥6 to <18 years with a baseline Yale Global Tic Severity Score Total Tic Score of ≥20 were randomly assigned 1:1 to ecopipam (n = 76) or placebo (n = 77). The primary endpoint was mean change over 12 weeks in the Yale Global Tic Severity Score Total Tic Score. The Clinical Global Impression of Tourette Syndrome Severity was the secondary endpoint. Safety and tolerability were evaluated at each study visit.


RESULTS
Total tic scores were significantly reduced from baseline to 12 weeks in the ecopipam group compared with placebo (least squares mean differences -3.44, 95% confidence interval -6.09 to -0.79, P = .01). Improvement in Clinical Global Impression of Tourette Syndrome Severity was also greater in the ecopipam group (P = .03). More weight gain was seen in subjects assigned to placebo. No metabolic or electrocardiogram changes were identified. Headache (15.8%), insomnia (14.5%), fatigue (7.9%), and somnolence (7.9%) were the most common adverse events.


CONCLUSIONS
Among children and adolescents with TS, ecopipam reduces tics to a greater extent than placebo, without observable evidence of common antipsychotic-associated side effects.",0

Total or partial edentulousness that is not filled with dental prostheses or that is filled with inadequate prostheses, associated with socioeconomic factors, depression, impaired motor functions, heart disease and a large number of chronic diseases including excessive use of drugs, often affects elderlies’ feeding. Aim: In this study, prosthetic rehabilitation was performed on some frail elderly residents in 10 nursing homes in the Lombardy district, and, subsequently, meal behavior and social activity were examined in two information questionnaires through compilation. Methods: The research was conducted on only 67 patients, 26 men and 41 women, aged between 75 and 99, who were guests in 10 health facilities (nursing homes) in the Lombard district; only 8 residents did not undergo prosthetic rehabilitation, as they did not cooperate. All the patients who were visited underwent oral prosthetic rehabilitation, and, subsequently, some aspects such as nutrition and socialization were assessed with other residents through the aid of two information dossiers. Results: the results showed that all the residents, despite difficulties in chewing with the new prosthesis, were fed and did not refuse more consistent foods; in addition, there was an improvement in social activity among the residents. Only 19.3% of men and 22% of women continued to eat little; there was an improvement in the participation in social activities among the residents, with a percentage of 73% of men and 88% of women; in particular, during meals 35 residents conversed with the other residents. Discussion: The dental problems of elderly people residing in social welfare homes are increasingly evident when other systemic pathologies are present. It would be desirable to introduce telemedicine in residences for the elderly for the monitoring of dental problems. Conclusions: From the information obtained and from the evaluation of the change in the elderly, it can be concluded that it would be desirable to include specific dental protocols to create a network, including a telematic one, to monitor and perform more dental checks in nursing homes.",0

The resulting ecosystems are highly complex, highly distributed, and highly dynamic, following inter-organizational and even international approaches. Even though based on international, but domain-specific models and standards, achieving interoperability between such systems integrating multiple domains managed by multiple disciplines and their individually skilled actors is cumbersome. Methods Using the abstract presentation of any system by the universal type theory as well as universal logics and combining the resulting Barendregt Cube with parameters and the engineering approach of cognitive theories, systems theory, and good modeling best practices, this study argues for a generic reference architecture model moderating between the different perspectives and disciplines involved provide on that system. To represent architectural elements consistently, an aligned system of ontologies is used. Results The system-oriented, architecture-centric, and ontology-based generic reference model allows for re-engineering the existing and emerging knowledge representations, models, and standards, also considering the real-world business processes and the related development process of supporting IT systems for the sake of comprehensive systems integration and interoperability. The solution enables the analysis, design, and implementation of dynamic, interoperable multi-domain systems without requesting continuous revision of existing specifications.",0

The lifelong electronic health records (EHR) structure and content require standardization efforts. The existing standards such as openEHR, HL7, and CEN TC251 EN 13606 (Technical committee on Health Informatics of the European Committee for Standardization) aim to achieve data independence along with semantic interoperability. This study aims to discover knowledge representation to achieve semantic health data exchange. OpenEHR and CEN TC251 EN 13606 use archetype-based technology for semantic interoperability. The HL7 Clinical Document Architecture is on its way to adopting this through HL7 templates. Archetypes are the basis for knowledge-based systems as these are means to define clinical knowledge. The paper examines a set of formalisms for the suitability of describing, representing, and reasoning about archetypes. Each of the information exchange technologies such as XML, Web Ontology Language, Object Constraint Language, and Knowledge Interchange Format is evaluated as a part of the knowledge representation experiment. These examine the representation of Archetypes as described by Archetype Definition Language.

While most of the previous studies have used fixed or time-of-use (TOU) prices for the optimal sizing of MGs, this work introduces real-time pricing (RTP) for implementing a demand response (DR) program according to the national grid prices of Iran. In addition to the long-term planning of MG, the day-ahead operation of MG is also analyzed to get a better understanding of the DR program for daily electricity dispatch. For this purpose, four different days corresponding to the four seasons are selected for further analysis. In addition, various impacts of the proposed DR program on the MG planning results, including sizing and best configuration, net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE), and emission generation by the utility grid, are investigated. The optimization results show that the implementation of the DR program has a positive impact on the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of MG. The NPC and COE are reduced by about USD 3700 and USD 0.0025/kWh, respectively. The component size is also reduced, resulting in a reduction in the initial cost.

The main contribution of this paper is to propose and implement a fuzzy ontology-based semantic interoperability framework for distributed EHR systems. First, a separate standard ontology is created for each input source. Second, a unified ontology is created that merges the previously created ontologies. However, this crisp ontology is not able to answer vague or uncertain queries. We thirdly extend the integrated crisp ontology into a fuzzy ontology by using a standard methodology and fuzzy logic to handle this limitation. The used dataset includes identified data of 100 patients. The resulting fuzzy ontology includes 27 class, 58 properties, 43 fuzzy data types, 451 instances, 8376 axioms, 5232 logical axioms, 1216 declarative axioms, 113 annotation axioms, and 3204 data property assertions. The resulting ontology is tested using real data from the MIMIC-III intensive care unit dataset and real archetypes from openEHR. This fuzzy ontology-based system helps physicians accurately query any required data about patients from distributed locations using near-natural language queries.

In federated learning, the cloud aggregates local model updates from the devices to generate a global model. To protect devices’ privacy, the cloud is designed to have no visibility into how these updates are generated, making detecting and defending malicious model updates a challenging task. Unlike existing works that struggle to tolerate adversarial attacks, the paper manages to exclude malicious updates from the global model’s aggregation. This paper focuses on Byzantine attack and backdoor attack in the federated learning setting. We propose a federated learning framework, which we call Federated Reconstruction Error Probability Distribution (FREPD). FREPD uses a VAE model to compute updates’ reconstruction errors. Updates with higher reconstruction errors than the average reconstruction error are deemed as malicious updates and removed. Meanwhile, we apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to choose a proper probability distribution function and tune its parameters to fit the distribution of reconstruction errors from observed benign updates. We then use the distribution function to estimate the probability that an unseen reconstruction error belongs to the benign reconstruction error distribution. Based on the probability, we classify the model updates as benign or malicious. Only benign updates are used to aggregate the global model. FREPD is tested with extensive experiments on independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID federated benchmarks, showing a competitive performance over existing aggregation methods under Byzantine attack and backdoor attack.",0

However, the standard movements of various sports activities need professional guidance, so it is difficult to find out whether the movements are standard or not. In recent years, body pose estimation has become a hot topic in computer vision research. A deep learning model can effectively identify the human nodes and movement trajectory in pictures or videos and evaluate the movements of the target human body. However, the movement process is generally covered by others or the situation of nearby personnel, which leads to the deviation of the movement recognition of the human body and affects the evaluation of the movement. Thus, it is unable to effectively correct the wrong movement, but will mislead the training personnel. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel decision support model for sports training based on association rules. We use posterior probability settings to reveal the weights of the discriminative ability of attribute items and set the classification performance to reflect the weights of three measures to evaluate credit contribution. Thus, the learning threshold setting reflects the weight of the decision-making ability of sports training. Furthermore, compared with traditional association rules, attribute items, frequent item sets, and classification rules that can improve the decision-making performance of sports training are discovered, which complement the deficiencies of different measures. Finally, using the weighted voting strategy to fuse the decision-making information of the classification rules, we can effectively assist in sports training so that the coach can work out corresponding countermeasures and realize scientific management.",0

The effective population size (Ne) is a useful measure for quantifying genetic drift. Evaluating relative contributions of different demographic factors to Ne is therefore important to identify what makes a population vulnerable to loss of genetic variation. Until recently, models for estimating Ne have required many simplifying assumptions, making them unsuitable for this task. Here, using data from a small, harvested moose population, we demonstrate the use of a stochastic demographic framework allowing for fluctuations in both population size and age distribution to estimate and decompose the total demographic variance and hence the ratio of effective to total population size (Ne/N) into components originating from sex, age, survival and reproduction. We not only show which components contribute most to Ne/N currently, but also which components have the greatest potential for changing Ne/N. In this relatively long‐lived polygynous system we show that Ne/N is most sensitive to the demographic variance of older males, and that both reproductive autocorrelations (i.e., a tendency for the same individuals to be successful several years in a row) and covariance between survival and reproduction contribute to decreasing Ne/N (increasing genetic drift). These conditions are common in nature and can be caused by common hunting strategies. Thus, the framework presented here has great potential to increase our understanding of the demographic processes that contribute to genetic drift and viability of populations, and to inform management decisions.",0

Waterfowl with precocial young face particularly high costs of egg production, incubation, and brood-rearing, but not all evidence supports a corresponding decline in survival. We used multi-state mark–recapture–recovery models to estimate annual probabilities of survival, reported mortality, and transition between 2 states for female Ross's Geese (Anser rossii) and Lesser Snow Geese (A. caerulescens caerulescens) that attempted nesting near Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada. States were possession of a brood patch (high likelihood of successful nesting, “B”) vs. no brood patch (attempted nesting but failed, “N”). Based on over 43,000 birds marked from 2000 to 2015, we found that females of each species with a brood patch had consistently higher probabilities of survival than those without, subsequent to capture in early August. Virtually all of the state differences in survival were due to nonhunting mortality. These patterns are consistent with the concept of variable individual quality impacting vital rates across multiple seasons. Higher survival of females with brood patches may be linked to greater breeding success but also to a hypothesized dominance advantage afforded to family groups of geese during winter. Moreover, although hunting pressure can play a key role in regulating Arctic goose populations, it does not appear to affect this relationship between inferred breeding state and survival. Instead, coincident with recent declines in harvest rate in these populations, higher individual quality of breeding females appears to outweigh the higher hunting vulnerability of presumed parents with young. The potential influence of social dominance in reducing natural winter mortality among families may thus contribute to the survival advantage seen in successful, relative to failed, breeders.",0

While short‐term costs have been extensively explored, the prevalence of cumulative long‐term costs and the circumstances under which such costs occur alongside or instead of short‐term costs, are far from clear. Indeed, few studies have simultaneously tested for both short‐term and cumulative long‐term reproductive costs in natural populations. Even in mammals, comparatively little is known about cumulative effects of previous reproduction, especially in species with high variation in offspring numbers, where costs could vary among successful reproductive events. Here, we quantify effects of previous short‐term and cumulative long‐term reproduction on current reproduction probability and litter size in wild female yellow‐bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and test how these effects vary with age and between two contrasting environments. We provide evidence for cumulative long‐term effects: females that had both reproduced frequently and weaned large litters on average in previous years had decreased current reproduction probability. We found no evidence for short‐term reproductive costs between reproductive bouts. However, females weaned larger litters when they had weaned larger litters on average in previous years and had lower current reproduction probability when their previous reproductive success was low. Together these results suggest that, alongside persistent among‐individual variation, long‐term reproductive history affects current reproductive success.",0

When affecting fitness-related traits such as survival or reproduction, individual heterogeneity plays a key role in population dynamics and life history evolution. However, it is only recently that properly accounting for individual heterogeneity when studying population dynamics of free-ranging populations has been made possible through the development of appropriate statistical models. We aim here to review case studies of individual heterogeneity in the context of capture-recapture models for the estimation of population size and demographic parameters with imperfect detection. First, we define what individual heterogeneity means and clarify the terminology used in the literature. Second, we review the literature and illustrate why individual heterogeneity is used in capture-recapture studies by focusing on the detection of life-history trade-offs, including senescence. Third, we explain how to model individual heterogeneity in capture-recapture models and provide the code to fit these models (https://github.com/oliviergimenez/indhet_in_CRmodels). The distinction is made between situations in which heterogeneity is actually measured and situations in which part of the heterogeneity remains unobserved. Regarding the latter, we outline recent developments of random-effect models and finite-mixture models. Finally, we discuss several avenues for future research.",0

LDLR expression is adjusted at the transcriptional level through sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) and at the post translational stages, specifically through PCSK9, and the inducible degrader of the LDLR PCSK9 inhibition is an appealing new method for reducing the concentration of LDL-C. In this review the role of PCSK9 in lipid homeostasis was elucidated, the effect of PCSK9 on atherosclerosis was highlighted, and contemporary therapeutic techniques that focused on PCSK9 were summarized.

Hypertension is the most common comorbidity for acute aortic dissection, and effective antihypertensive therapy is still unable to predict the risk of aortic rupture at the medium- and long-term stages. While the presence of renal cyst has been found to increases the risk of thoracic aortic disease, the correlation between renal cyst and TA-AAD with hypertension remains poorly understood. Thus, this study aimed to determine the relationship of renal cyst and TA-AAD with hypertension. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed in 464 hypertension patients from August 2014 to August 2019. A total of 230 TA-AAD patients were enrolled in the AD with hypertension group (age 53.79±11.31 years, male 90.87%), and matched by age, sex, and hypertension control to 234 patients without TA-AAD who were enrolled in the non-AD with hypertension group. Patients were divided into three subgroups according to the numbers of renal cysts: no renal cyst, single renal cyst, and multiple renal cysts. Results In this study, the AD with hypertension group had significantly more single renal cyst and multiple renal cyst cases than did the non-AD with hypertension group. The mean age of the multiple renal cyst subgroup was significantly older than that of the single renal cyst subgroup (57.25±13.00 vs. 51.57±10.75 years) in the AD with hypertension group. There was significantly different distribution of dissection starting points and dissection ending points across three renal cyst subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that having no renal cyst significantly decreased the risk of TA-AAD in middle-aged and elderly patents, but showed no correlations with those of younger ages. Single renal cyst status also significantly decreased the risk of TA-AAD in elderly patients [odds ratio (OR) =0.129, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.029–0.575, P=0.007]. Conclusions Renal cyst status correlates with the risk of TA-AAD with hypertension in middle-aged and elderly patients, and exhibits different degrees of vascular lesion in aortic dissection. We therefore suggest that different antihypertensive standards should be adopted in different renal cyst status to more effectively prevent aortic dissection.",0

In Dio 54.8.3 è sostenuto che l'impresa fu celebrata con la costruzione di un arco trionfale e di un tempio dedicato a Marte Ultore sul Campidoglio. Quest'ultimo sarebbe stata la sede delle insegne recuperate nell'impresa. Tuttavia, il passaggio sostiene anche che Augusto fu accolto da un'ovazione al suo ritorno a Roma, episodio che si sa non essere vero. In questo articolo viene suggerito che le onorificenze che Dio riporta furono votate dal Senato e o respinte totalmente da Augusto o accettate in una forma modificata. Augusto accettò l'idea di un tempio dove tenere le insegne, ma insistette che questo fosse costruito non sul Campidoglio, ma nel suo progettato nuovo foro. L'idea di un nuovo arco venne invece respinta da Augusto. Tuttavia egli accettò che il triplo arco eretto nel foro romano in onore della vittoria di Azio fosse modificato per commemorare il recupero delle insegne. Ulteriori onorificenze offerte ad Augusto al suo ritorno a Roma nel 19 a.C. includono un carro associato al proposto tempio di Marte Ultore; Augusto accettò che questo fosse eretto nel foro augusteo, e può quindi essere identificato con il carro menzionato nelle Res Gestae 35. Tali questioni fanno nuova luce sulla concezione e sul significato simbolico del foro augusteo e del tempio di Marte Ultore e forniscono una nuova soluzione all'annoso problema dell'arco di Augusto nel foro romano. Questo articolo ha anche un più ampio significato, quale illustrazione del modo in cui i processi onorifici potessero fungere da dialogo tra i sudditi e l'imperatore.",0

Between 1898 and 1903 Giacomo Boni's intensive work had resulted in sensational finds—the Lapis Niger, the republican Comitium and the archaic cemetery ; he had finished excavating both on the north side of the Forum, uncovering the front of the Basilica Aemilia and the Curia, and to the south, where the shrine of the Fountain of Juturna had returned to light, together with the approach from the Forum to the Imperial Palace and the series of early Christian paintings in S. Maria Antiqua. Excavation of the House of the Vestals was also brought to completion. Interest in republican and archaic development had led to investigation beneath the paving of the Forum itself (Equus Domitiani, Lacus Curtius, underground galleries and ritual wells and pits), and to a search for the ancient track of the Via Sacra, with exploration of its shops and wells of Republican date. A mass of information and material collected as a result of these excavations has unfortunately, although scrupulously catalogued, remained largely unpublished.

Materials and Methods: An ecological study was performed using the National Cancer Database among stage I-IVA cervical cancer patients from 2004 to 2014. Data from the National Cancer Institute, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, and the United States Census were compiled to describe access to care by region. Factors associated with receipt of optimal treatment (defined as surgery and/or radiation for stage IA-IB1 and IIA1; radiation and chemotherapy for stage IB2, IIA2, IIB-IVA or node positive disease) were identified using multivariate logistic regressions stratified by region, controlling for confounding factors including the number of gynecologic oncologists per states in each subregion. Cox multivariate survival analyses stratified by region were also performed. Results: Of 42,213 women, 17.0% were Black. On multivariate analysis controlling for confounders, all Southern women were less likely to receive optimal treatment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.80, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.75–0.85, P<0.001) compared with Northeastern women. Black women in the South (aOR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.70–0.83, P<0.001) and Midwest (aOR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.68–0.90, P<0.001) were less likely to receive optimal treatment compared with non-Black women in those regions. Black women in the South (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.18, P<0.001) and West (aHR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.11–1.62, P=0.002) had worse mortality compared with non-Black women in those regions, despite controlling for access to gynecologic oncologists. The South, Midwest, and West had proportionally fewer cancer centers and gynecologic oncologists compared with the Northeast. Conclusions: Southern women are at risk of inadequate treatment for cervical cancer, and Black Southern women are at even higher risk of inadequate treatment and worse overall survival despite controlling for access to gynecologic oncologists. Social determinants of health and other barriers besides access to oncologists likely contribute to observed regional and racial disparities among cervical cancer patients.",0

We hypothesize that overcrowding may cause indirect health effects by adversely affecting the dwelling itself, for example, by increasing dampness leading to mold. We therefore performed a systematic search and a scoping review on overcrowding leading to dwelling condition characteristics of relevance for health. A literature search was performed using the PubMed and Scopus databases up to 5 March 2021. The search yielded 100 records with relevant information. We found that overcrowding is defined in numerous ways and often address “socially deprived” populations. Six studies report associations of overcrowding with at least one dwelling condition characteristic, namely lead, cadmium, microorganism distribution, dust mite and cockroach allergens in dust, cockroach infestation, peeling paint, and mold. One of the studies reports associations between several characteristics, e.g., association of mold with cleanliness and rodent infestation, and points out the common use of pesticides. Additional characteristics were extracted from the remaining 94 records, without data on statistical associations with overcrowding. Our review suggests that multiple potentially hazardous dwelling condition characteristics often coincide in overcrowded dwellings. The epidemiological attribution of health effects to any characteristic is therefore difficult. Causal relationships are even more difficult to establish, as overcrowding is also associated with a range of social and other circumstances that may affect health. The complexity should be considered by scientists and practitioners dealing with overcrowding in dwellings.",0

We used the PTP scale as a research tool, taking physicians of the hospitals in Anhui region as the research object to carry out the investigation of PTP, Python software was applied to explore the status of PTP, and the differences of PBPTP distribution rate with different demographic characteristic variables were compared by testing based on theory of planned behavior. We get six results as follows: (1) the overall PTP level was low, and nearly 50% of doctors doubt the integrity of patients. “Patients will not be driven by improper interests” becomes the most reluctant problem or the most distrustful option for doctors. (2) In terms of patients’ participation in disease management and regular follow-up visits, PTP rate in male was higher than that in female (Ps < 0.018). (3) PBPTP was affected by age (Ps < 0.017). (4) In terms of the behavior of patients who did not follow the treatment plans, the PTP rate of postgraduates and above physicians was higher than that of undergraduates and below (P=0.017). (5) In terms of providing diagnosis and treatment information, timely notification of illness, medication information, doctor-patient communication behaviors, and compliance with doctors’ treatment plans, PBPTP was affected by doctors’ professional titles and annual income levels (Ps ≤ 0.001), At the same time, PTP levels of different professional titles showed differences in patients’ respect for doctors’ time and bottom line (Ps ≤ 0.001). (6) In terms of doctor-patient communication behaviors, PBPTP was affected by physician departments (P≤0.001).

Recent studies have addressed factors which affect the tension of doctor-patient relationships, and our study continues this trend by looking at the influence of resiliency and physician trust in the patient (PTP), that is, how much the doctor trusts the patient. Methods Based on a survey of 329 physicians, a descriptive analysis of measured data was done using SPSS 19.0. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to examine the correlation between PTP and resilience and the demographic variables. KMO and Bartlett methods were used to examine the correlation between PTPS and resilience. The method of factor analysis was used for multicollinearity tests, and multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to explore the demographic factors correlated with PTP and resilience. Result Our results indicate that the level of PTP is influenced by the age, education, and income of the doctors. Physician age and income are significantly and positively correlated with PTP, but education is significantly and negatively related. Age, education, and income also affect the level of psychological resilience of physicians. Resilience is positively correlated with age and education but is negatively related to income. Resilience positively influences PTP. Conclusion The direct factors of PTP include resilience, age, education, and income, while gender, title, and hospital department were found to be indirect influencing factors. To meet goals expressed in Chinese government policy related to these issues, we suggest improving the level of education of the doctors, providing reasonable annual salary increases for doctors, easing the tensions involved in medical treatment, reducing the physicians’ work pressure, improving the physicians’ work environment, and enhancing the physicians’ professional sympathy. Through such measures, the level of PTP will be enhanced.",0

For patients with primary cutaneous melanoma, the risk of sentinel node (SN) metastasis varies according to several clinicopathologic parameters. Patient selection for SN biopsy can be assisted by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and ASCO/Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) guidelines and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) online nomogram. We sought to develop an improved online risk calculator using alternative clinicopathologic parameters to more accurately predict SN positivity.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Data from 3,477 patients with melanoma who underwent SN biopsy at Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) were analyzed. A new nomogram was developed by replacing body site and Clark level from the MSKCC model with mitotic rate, melanoma subtype, and lymphovascular invasion. The predictive performance of the new nomogram was externally validated using data from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (n = 3,496).


RESULTS
The MSKCC model receiver operating characteristic curve had a predictive accuracy of 67.7% (95% CI, 65.3% to 70.0%). The MIA model had a predictive accuracy of 73.9% (95% CI, 71.9% to 75.9%), a 9.2% increase in accuracy over the MSKCC model (P < .001). Among the 2,748 SN-negative patients, SN biopsy would not have been offered to 22.1%, 13.4%, and 12.4% based on the MIA model, the MSKCC model, and NCCN or ASCO/SSO criteria, respectively. External validation generated a C-statistic of 75.0% (95% CI, 73.2% to 76.7%).


CONCLUSION
A robust nomogram was developed that more accurately estimates the risk of SN positivity in patients with melanoma than currently available methods. The model only requires the input of 6 widely available clinicopathologic parameters. Importantly, the number of patients undergoing unnecessary SN biopsy would be significantly reduced compared with use of the MSKCC nomogram or the NCCN or ASCO/SSO guidelines, without losing sensitivity.

The first and second hydration shells were treated by ab initio quantum mechanics at restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) level using the cc‐pVDZ‐PP basis set for Ge (II) and Dunning double‐ζ plus polarization basis sets for O and H. Besides ligand exchange processes and mean ligand residence times to observe dynamics, tilt‐ and theta‐angle distributions along with an advanced structural parameter, namely radial and angular distribution functions (RAD) for different regions were also evaluated. The combined radial and angular distribution depicted through surface plot and contour map is presented to provide a detailed insight into the density distribution of water molecules around the Ge2+ ion. A strongly distorted hydration structure with two trigonal pyramidal substructures within the first hydration shell is observed, which demonstrates the lone‐pair influence and provides a new basis for the interpretation of the catalytic and pharmacological properties of germanium coordination compounds. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Most protein samples contain a few major proteins, which hamper in-depth proteomic analysis. In the human field, combinatorial hexapeptide ligand libraries (CPLL; such as ProteoMiner) have been used for reduction of the dynamic range of protein concentrations; however, this technique is not established in plant research. In this work, we present the application of CPLL to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf proteins. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed a decrease in high-abundance proteins and an enrichment of less abundant proteins in CPLL-treated samples. After optimization of the CPLL protocol, mass spectrometric analyses of leaf extracts led to the identification of 1,192 proteins in control samples and an additional 512 proteins after the application of CPLL. Upon leaf infection with virulent Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, CPLL beads were also used for investigating the bacterial infectome. In total, 312 bacterial proteins could be identified in infected Arabidopsis leaves. Furthermore, phloem exudates of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) were analyzed. CPLL prefractionation caused depletion of the major phloem proteins 1 and 2 and improved phloem proteomics, because 67 of 320 identified proteins were detectable only after CPLL treatment. In sum, our results demonstrate that CPLL beads are a time- and cost-effective tool for reducing major proteins, which often interfere with downstream analyses. The concomitant enrichment of less abundant proteins may facilitate a deeper insight into the plant proteome.",0

Strain Et1/99 represents an epiphytic plant bacterium related to Erwinia amylovora and E. pyrifoliae, which are responsible for the important plant diseases fire blight and Asian pear shoot blight, respectively. Strain Et1/99 is a non-pathogenic bacterium and is thought to compete with these and other bacteria when occupying the same habitat during initial colonization. Genome analysis revealed tools for colonization, cellular communication and defence modulation, as well as genes coding for the synthesis of levan and a not detected capsular exopolysaccharide. Strain Et1/99 may secrete indole-3-acetic acid to increase availability of nutrients provided on plant surfaces. These nutrients are subsequently accessed and metabolized. Secretion systems include the hypersensitive response type III pathway present in many pathogens. Differences or missing parts within the virulence-related factors distinguish strain Et1/99 from pathogens such as Pectobacterium atrosepticum and the related Erwinia spp. Strain Et1/99 completely lacks the sorbitol operon, which may also affect its inability to invade fire blight host plants. Erwinia amylovora in contrast depends for virulence on utilization of sorbitol, the dominant carbohydrate in rosaceous plants. The presence of other virulence-associated factors in strain Et1/99 indicates the ancestral genomic background of many plant-associated bacteria.",0

Data from bike trips and a Citi Bike enrollment survey for the period 2013–2018 were used for this analysis. Associations comparing female to male members on selected study variables were examined through the estimation of odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using bivariate logistic regression models and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for continuous non-normal data. Spatial autocorrelation of bike share station pick ups and drop offs by percentage of female bike share members was detected using local Moran’s I. This study included 226,237 Citi Bike members; of these, over one-third (38.1%) self-identified as female. The optional enrollment survey was completed by 33,945 members; of these, 37.9% self-identified as female. Compared to male gender, female gender was associated with younger age, higher levels of education completed, being a student and not employed, and lower household income, as well as social and health reasons for membership rather than utilitarian reasons. Overall, female members took fewer bike share trips (median: 46.0 per year vs. 78.5 for males). There was spatial correlation between station usage and gender, with female members more likely than male members to use Citi Bikes in less dense neighborhoods. The results from this study highlight the gender disparity in bike share membership and usage in NYC and provide insight into how this gap could be reduced.",0

Ascertainment of asbestosis and mesothelioma from underlying cause of death underestimates the burden of these diseases. The aims of this study were to estimate the true frequency of asbestosis and mesothelioma among asbestos workers in Great Britain (GB), and to identify factors associated with the risk of death with these diseases.


METHODS
The GB Asbestos Survey was established in 1971 to monitor long-term health outcomes among workers covered by regulations to control asbestos at work. Asbestosis and mesothelioma cases were defined by multiple cause of death, and were ascertained by identifying asbestos workers on the GB Asbestosis and Mesothelioma Registers. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated; the risks of asbestosis and mesothelioma were modeled with Poisson regression analysis. Deaths to the end of 2005 were included.


RESULTS
There were 15,557 deaths between 1971 and 2005 among the 98,912 workers. Altogether 477 asbestosis and 649 mesothelioma cases were identified. The SMR for all causes was 1.42, for asbestosis 51.3, and for mesothelioma 13.5. In multiply adjusted analysis, age, sex, job, and birth cohort were significantly associated with asbestosis and mesothelioma. For asbestosis year of first exposure, and for mesothelioma latency, were also statistically significant.


CONCLUSIONS
The asbestos workers experienced high mortality from all causes, asbestosis, and mesothelioma. There was some evidence that the risk of asbestosis and mesothelioma was lower in later birth cohorts and among those first occupationally exposed to asbestos more recently. Due to the long latency of both diseases, further follow-up is required to confirm these trends.",0

We calculated national, state, and county death rates, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population. We also calculated industry- and occupation-specific proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs), adjusted for age, sex, and race, and corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) using available data. The overall U.S. age-adjusted asbestosis death rate was 4.1 per million population per year; the rate for males (10.4) was nearly 35-fold higher than that for females (0.3). It increased significantly from 0.6 to 6.9 per million population from 1970 to 2000 (p<0.001),and then declined to 6.3 in 2004 (p=0.014). High asbestosis death rates occurred predominantly, though not exclusively, in coastal areas. Industries with highest PMRs included ship and boat building and repairing (18.5; 95% CI 16.3–20.9) and miscellaneous nonmetallic mineral and stone products (15.9; 95% CI 13.0–19.5). Occupations with highest PMRs included insulation workers (109.2; 95% CI 93.8-127.2) and boilermakers (21.3; 95% CI 17.0–26.6).",0

Tobacco use and resultant health effects have been described as an epidemic that progresses through the population. This paper aims to describe and explain trends in lung cancer mortality by ethnicity and socioeconomic position in New Zealand between 1981-1999.


METHODS
Cohort studies of the entire New Zealand population for 1981-84, 1986-89, 1991-94, and 1996-99 (linking census and mortality datasets) allowed direct determination of trends in lung mortality by income and education. For ethnicity, we used unlinked census and mortality data--but with correction factors applied for undercounting of Maori and Pacific deaths.


RESULTS
Lung cancer mortality decreased in males and increased in females over the time period studied. In males, socioeconomic inequality persisted despite a decline in mortality in all socioeconomic groups. In females, a disproportionate increase in the mortality of lower socioeconomic groups compared to higher socioeconomic groups resulted in an increase in inequality. Divergent trends by ethnic group resulted in an increase in ethnic inequalities between 1981 and 1996 in both males and females.


CONCLUSIONS
There are significant and growing ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in lung cancer mortality in New Zealand. In the current absence of concerted public health action these inequalities will probably widen in future decades.",0

Clinically, it is given to cancer patients with high and moderate emetogenic chemotherapy to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). The facts produced in this research support the interpretation of teratogenic effects like anatomical malformations and abnormal skeletal changes affected by high doses of rolapitant in developed chick embryos, which can be extrapolated to humans due to gaps in the literature regarding the teratogenic potential of rolapitant. As rolapitant is metabolized by the liver and excreted through the kidney by leaving a deep impact on the various systems of the body and due to its high plasma concentration with a half-life of more than 180 hours, the study was conducted to acquire some additional information about its adverse effects over the various body systems. Chick is one of the best animals for embryological laboratory research. For various reasons, it is preferred to research embryology in chicks or domestic hens (Gallus domesticus). Chick eggs are large, readily available all year, easy to incubate, and regulate artificially. Aim This study aimed to determine the morphological and skeletal abnormalities due to the effect of rolapitant, an antiemetic agent, in developing White Leghorn (G. domesticus) chicken eggs. Materials and methods The experiment used 300 fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs. The eggs were categorized into five experimental groups (A, B, C, D, and E, each with 30 eggs) and five control groups (a, b, c, d, and e, each with 30 eggs). Rolapitant was administered into the five experimental groups of eggs on incubation day five at various concentrations of 0.00039, 0.0005, 0.00075, 0.001, and 0.00125 mg, respectively, while the control groups received the same volume (0.039, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, and 0.125 ml, respectively) of normal saline. Results At all doses, the mean weight and crown-rump (CR) length of chick embryos were significantly greater in the control group than in the experimental group. The experimental group died at a higher rate than the control group. Additionally, it was found that the mortality due to the rolapitant dosages increases with dose. All groups except group A showed skeletal anomalies such as poor ossification, bent, and displacement, and morphological abnormalities such as yolk sac retraction, hematoma, and scanty feathers were found in experimental groups C, D, and E. This was shown to be more prevalent in the experimental groups and was exacerbated by subsequent rolapitant dosages. Conclusion Rolapitant is toxic when taken in large doses and for an extended period. As a result, rolapitant should be taken only when a valid diagnosis has been established and only at the recommended dose, not at a larger dose or for an extended period of time.",0

Areas covered: This review presents the evidence base for the use of oral and intravenous (IV) NK1RAs, focusing on the pharmacologic and clinical properties as a class, and highlighting differences between agents. A PubMed literature search was conducted from 2000 to 2018. Expert opinion: Adherence to international antiemetic guidelines remains a clinical challenge. Strategies to simplify antiemetic regimens and facilitate their administration may improve compliance and treatment outcomes. The use of fixed-combination antiemetics offers clinical utility, in combining an NK1RA with a 5-HT3RA in a single oral dose. The use of long-lasting NK1RAs and administering CINV prophylaxis closer to the time of chemotherapy may also assist with guideline and treatment compliance, diminishing the need for home-based administration, and potentially reducing resource utilization. The availability of IV and oral formulations of NK1RAs and NK1RA–5-HT3RA fixed combinations offers further utility, particularly for those patients unsuited for oral administration. However, safety considerations with respect to injection site toxicity and hypersensitivity reactions of the new NK1RA IV formulations deserve close attention.",0

Phase 3 clinical trials showed a significantly higher complete response rate in both acute and delayed CINV in chemotherapy-naïve patients receiving NEPA compared to patients receiving palonosetron. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the budgetary impact of adding NEPA to a US payer or practice formulary for CINV prophylaxis. Methods: A model was developed to estimate the impact of adding NEPA to the formulary of a hypothetical US payer with 1.15 million members, including 150,000 (13%) Medicare beneficiaries. The model compared the annual total costs of CINV-related events and CINV prophylaxis in two scenarios: base year (no NEPA) and comparator year (10% and 5% NEPA usage in HEC and MEC patients, respectively). A univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the effect of variability in model parameters on the budget impact. Results: A total of 2,021 patients were eligible to receive CINV prophylaxis. With NEPA, CINV prophylaxis costs increased by 0.7% ($3,493,630 vs $3,518,760) while medical costs associated with CINV events decreased by 3.9% ($15,118,639 vs $14,532,442), resulting in a net cost saving of $561,067 (3.0%) for the health plan ($18,612,269 vs $18,051,202), or $0.04 per member per month. This was equivalent to saving $5,011 per patient moved to NEPA. Among all 5-HT3 RA + NK1 RA regimens, NEPA was associated with the lowest CINV-related costs, leading to the lowest total cost of care. Conclusions: Adding NEPA to a payer or practice formulary results in a net decrease in the total budget due to a substantial reduction in CINV event-related resource utilization and medical costs, and an increase in pharmacy costs <1%, saving over $5,000 per patient.",0

Opioid medications are integral in managing acute moderate-to-severe pain. Opioid analgesics bind to μ (mu), κ (kappa), or δ (delta) opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and digestive tract. However, opioids cause adverse effects that may interfere with their therapeutic use. Some adverse effects wane over time, but patients using opioids for acute pain struggle with opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV) the entire time they take the opioid. This article discusses the underlying mechanisms, clinical implications, and treatment strategies of OINV.


DATA SOURCES
Systematic search and review of Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar for articles relating to OINV. In addition, package inserts provided pharmacologic data and dose recommendations as needed.


CONCLUSIONS
Research suggests approximately 40% of patients may experience nausea and 15%-25% of patients may experience vomiting after opioid administration. Nausea often precedes vomiting, although they can occur separately. Many patients receiving opioids rate the nausea and vomiting as worse than their pain. Nausea and vomiting can lead to complications including electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, and volume depletion, and can also negatively affect quality of life and postoperative recovery.


IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
There are several medications that can be used to treat OINV including serotonin receptor antagonists, dopamine receptor antagonists, and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists. Healthcare providers should be proactive about discussing OINV with patients, as this may improve patient outcomes and pain relief.",0

Such a failure compensation control problem is solved by using a new control separation design based on a new linear quadratic (LQ) control formulation: One control component is used for disturbance rejection and actuator failure compensation, and one component is used for closed-loop stability and regulation, to achieve the desired control objective. The nominal LQ control solution uses a new cost function to derive the two-component control signal, which has improved performance over a traditional LQ control design. The adaptive actuator failure compensation control problem is solved using a stable adaptive law for parameter estimation, to guarantee the system stability and output regulation performances in the presence of plant and actuator failure uncertainties. Simulation results are presented to verify the satisfactory performance of the proposed adaptive LQ control scheme.",0

We design optimal state-feedback controllers for interconnected discrete-time linear systems with stochastically-varying parameters. The parameters are assumed to be independently and identically distributed random variables in time. The design of each controller relies only on (i) exact local plant model information and (ii) statistical beliefs about the model of the rest of the system. We consider both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon quadratic cost functions. The optimal state-feedback controller is derived in both cases. The optimal controller is shown to be linear in the state and to depend on the model parameters and their statistics in a particular way. Furthermore, we study the value of model information in optimal control design using the performance degradation ratio which is defined as the supremum (over all possible initial conditions) of the ratio of the cost of the optimal controller with limited model information scaled by the cost of the optimal controller with full model information. An upper bound for the performance degradation ratio is presented for the case of fully-actuated subsystems. Comparisons are made between designs based on limited, statistical, and full model information. Throughout the paper, we use a power network example to illustrate concepts and results.",0

Traditional control design cannot be easily applied due to the unconventional information patterns, communication network imperfections, and design procedure complexities. How to control large-scale systems is of immediate societal importance as they appear in many emerging applications, such as intelligent transportation systems, smart grids, and energy-efficient buildings. In this thesis, we make three contributions to the problem of designing networked controller under information asymmetries and limitations.In the first contribution, we investigate how to design local controllers to optimize a cost function using only partial knowledge of the model governing the system. Specifically, we derive some fundamental limitations in the closed-loop performance when the design of each controller only relies on local plant model information. Results are characterized in the structure of the networked system as well as in the available model information. Both deterministic and stochastic formulations are considered for the closed-loop performance and the available information. In the second contribution of the thesis, we study decision making in transportation systems using heterogeneous routing and congestion games. It is shown that a desirable global behavior can emerge from simple local strategies used by the drivers to choose departure times and routes. Finally, the third contribution is a novel stochastic sensor scheduling policy for ad-hoc networked systems, where a varying number of control loops are active at any given time. It is shown that the policy provides stochastic guarantees for the network resources dynamically allocated to each loop.",0

The beginning of adjuvant was mineral oil which enhanced the immune response when it was given with inactivated Salmonella typhimurium. Aluminium salt was used to precipitate diphtheria toxoid and increased level of antibody response was demonstrated when administered with alum-precipitated antigens. Since 1930, aluminium salt has been used as DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine) adjuvant. Many candidates were tested for adjuvant activity but only aluminum salt is allowed to use for human vaccines. New adjuvant MF59, oil-in-water emulsion type, was developed for influenza vaccine for elderly (Fluad) and series of AS adjuvant are used for hepatitis B, pandemic flue, and human papiloma virus vaccines. Oil-adjuvanted influenza pandemic vaccines induced higher antibody response than alum-adjuvanted vaccine with higher incidence of adverse events, especially for local reactions. Alum-adjuvanted whole virion inactivated H5N1 vaccine was developed in Japan, and it induced relatively well immune responses in adults. When it applied for children, febrile reaction was noted in approximately 60% of the subjects, with higher antibodies. Recent investigation on innate immunity demonstrates that adjuvant activity is initiated from the stimulation on innate immunity and/or inflammasome, resulting in cytokine induction and antigen uptake by monocytes and macrophages. The probable reason for high incidence of febrile reaction should be investigated to develop a safe and effective influenza vaccine.",0

The annual epidemics result in the host population updating its pool of humoral immunity by exposure to the most recent viruses carrying altered antigenic specificity caused by ‘antigen shift’ in the haemagglutinin (H) ligand. Pandemics are caused by ‘antigen drift’. They occur at intervals and give rise to high morbidity and mortality. Influenza viruses are RNA viruses with a segmental genome comprising eight parts. ‘Antigen drift’ and ‘shift’ arise from these characteristics (Fig. 1). The RNA genome is transcribed by the polymerase that the virus carries. The transcription is associated with many point mutations persistently causing changes in virus proteins including surface proteins HA and NA (neuraminidase), and thereby causing the ‘antigen drift’ [1]. Antigen drift enables the virus to escape onslaught by the host’s immune defences. Segmentation of the genome facilitates reassortment when two or more viral variants happen to infect the same cell. The progeny virus gets a mixed genome with a different viral structure. The emergence of H3N2 virus, as indeed of several other variants, has been traced to such a genomic reassortment [2]. Two envelope proteins stick out as spikes which the virus uses for entry into host cells (H, agglutinin) and exit by the progeny of the virus (N, neuraminidase). Influenza A viruses are subtyped into 16H (H1 to H16) and 9N (N1 to N9) giving a theoretical possibility of 144 serological subtypes. Up to now 105 influenza A subtypes have been discovered, of which all are endemic in water birds (ducks, geese and gulls). Some subtypes have adapted to other birds (chickens) and mammals (pigs, horses and humans) [3]. Influenza pandemics occur when an influenza virus strain is transmitted to humans from another animal species. Species that are considered important from this respect are pigs, chicken and ducks. For example, in 1997 during an outbreak in chickens in Hong Kong the avian influenza virus H5N1 crossed the species barrier and infected 18 persons of whom six died. Since then antigenic variants of the virus have continued to appear in domestic and wild birds. During the 20th century, four pandemics of influenza have been recorded (Table 1). The current swine flu pandemic is the first one of the 21st century. Viruses of the H5N1 subtype are highly pathogenic for humans [4]. Currently both H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses are continuing to circulate in the human population. They are comparatively low pathogenic variants except for the elderly during the winter months. H3N2 infections have caused almost 14 times more influenza-related deaths than H1N1 infections since 1970 [5]. Worldwide the annual seasonal influenza A epidemics result in about 3–5 million cases of severe illness and about 250 000–500 000 deaths (http://www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/index.html). The receptor sites on the host cell are sialic acid residues in the glycolipid components of the cell membrane. The cell membranes of birds have a different configuration of sialic acid compared with mammals. In the pig trachea, however, epithelial cells contain both avian and mammalian configuration which explains why pigs are susceptible to both avian and mammalian viruses. Thus, while aquatic birds are the reservoirs of influenza virus, pigs provide a ‘mixing cauldron’ for reassortments from which may arise a pandemic strain [6]. Pandemics are believed to be rare events in which viruses that circulate among humans acquire a new HA ligand of avian origin. The H1 variants have circulated among humans from 1918 to 1957, and again from 1977 to the present. Following the pandemic of highly virulent H5N1 ‘bird flu’ in chicken and evidence of its transmissibility to humans, there have been warnings of an impending pandemic of H5N1 bird flu in the human population [7]. Hence the scientific community was taken by surprise when a pathogenic new strain of influenza A was identified in Mexico in March 2009, and within days hundreds of more suspected cases were being diagnosed. In 2 months’ time, 33 countries had officially reported 5 728 cases resulting in 61 deaths, and by June 2009 WHO reported 30 000 confirmed cases in 74 countries. Currently WHO has raised the pandemic alert level to 6, the highest level. The new variant has been identified as originating from the H1N1 form of swine influenza—a descendant of the strain that caused the 1918 pandemic (http:// www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu). The virus is now labelled as ‘swine origin influenza A virus’ (S-OIV in short). The current strain has a high human-to-human transmission rate, the secondary attack rate being 25–30% to family members compared with 5–20% JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS, VOL. 56, NO. 1, 2010",0

To study the role of the plexin-A2 receptor in semaphorin signaling, we silenced its expression in endothelial cells and in glioblastoma cells. The silencing did not affect Sema3A signaling, which depended on neuropilin-1, plexin-A1 and plexin-A4, but completely abolished Sema3B signaling, which also required plexin-A4 and one of the two neuropilins. Interestingly, overexpression of plexin-A2 in plexin-A1- or plexin-A4-silenced cells restored responses to both semaphorins, although it nullified their ability to differentiate between them, suggesting that, when overexpressed, plexin-A2 can functionally replace other class A plexins. By contrast, although plexin-A4 overexpression restored Sema3A signaling in plexin-A1-silenced cells, it failed to restore Sema3B signaling in plexin-A2-silenced cells. It follows that the identity of plexins in functional semaphorin receptors can be flexible depending on their expression level. Our results suggest that changes in the expression of plexins induced by microenvironmental cues can trigger differential responses of different populations of migrating cells to encountered gradients of semaphorins.",0

Non-microinjected and non-vitrified embryos were used as the control. Morphological signs of injury to embryo organelles were determined at the ultrastructural level using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Morphometric evaluation was performed on cellular organelles using microphotographs obtained by TEM. Intact and Mi embryos recovered from in vivo fertilized eggs at 19–20 hours post coitum (hpc) were cultured for up to 72 hpc (morula stage), evaluated for the EGFP gene integration and then vitrified in 0.25 ml insemination straws in modified EFS (40% ethylene glycol + 18% Ficoll 70 + 0.3 M sucrose) vitrification solution. After 1–3 days the embryos were devitrified, a representative selection of embryos was analyzed by TEM and the remaining embryos were subjected to additional in vitro culture. Observations by TEM showed that the vitrified/warmed EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative embryos had a slight accumulation of cellular debris and lipid droplets compared with the control intact embryos. More severe changes were detected in the membrane structures of the treated embryos, mostly in the cytoplasmic envelope, trophoblastic microvilli, junctional contacts and mitochondria. We suggest that the higher proportion of deteriorated cell structures and organelles in the treated embryos may be due to the vitrification process rather than to mechanical violation (the gene-microinjection procedure), as a detailed inspection of ultrastructure revealed that most damage occurred in the cell membrane structures.",0

It can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) aiming to find a small feature subset while achieving a high classification accuracy. With traditional MOP, the focus is on deriving an optimal solution (i.e., a feature subset), while ignoring the diversity in solution space (e.g., there could exist multiple feature subsets achieving the same accuracy). Providing more options for feature selection would be beneficial since some features can be more difficult to obtain than others. In this work, we treat feature selection as a multimodal MOP (MMOP) whose goals are to find an excellent Pareto front in objective space and as many equivalent Pareto optimal solutions (feature subsets) as possible in feature space. Note that though several multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) have been proposed, their use of a convergence-first selection criterion could cause the loss of solution diversity in an objective and feature space. To address the issue, a novel competition-driven mechanism is designed to assist the existing multimodal MMEAs in locating more equivalent feature subsets and a desired Pareto front. The effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is first verified on all 22 MMOPs from CEC2019. Then, the proposed method is applied to feature selection in imbalanced classification problems and a real-world application, i.e., credit card fraud detection. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can not only provide more equivalent feature subsets but also improve classification accuracy.",0

For such a system, we aim to minimize the energy consumption by jointly optimizing the deployment and flight trajectory of UAV. It is a mixed-integer non-convex and NP-hard problem. In order to address it, a bilevel optimization approach is proposed, where an upper-level method aims to optimize the deployment of UAV and a lower-level one aims to plan UAV flight trajectory. Specifically, the former optimizes the number and locations of footholds of UAV. This work proposes an improved dandelion algorithm with a novel encoding strategy, in which each dandelion represents a foothold of UAV and the entire dandelion population is seen as an entire deployment. Then, two mutation strategies are designed to adjust the number and locations of footholds. Based on the footholds of the UAV provided by the former, the latter transforms flight trajectory planning into a traveling salesman problem (TSP). This work proposes an iterated greedy algorithm to solve it efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed bilevel optimization approach is verified on ten instances, and the experimental results show that it significantly outperforms other benchmark approaches.",0

This work analyzes the storage overhead of blocks, storage load of nodes, and reliability of a consortium blockchain and designs a storage optimization method to reduce the storage overhead and improve the reliability of a blockchain system. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms Multi-layer Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, RapidChain, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance-Store in terms of storage overhead and reliability.",0

However, the accuracy of internal markers is dependent upon the incubation technique utilized as bag type (BT) and incubation length (IL) can be significant sources of error. Previous studies have primarily focused on iDM and iNDF as digestibility markers, but few studies have compared digestibility estimates to those of acid detergent insoluble ash (ADIA). Therefore, our objective was to investigate the effect of BT (F57, F58, and Dacron) and IL (288 and 576 h) on iDM and iNDF residues, DM and NDF digestibilities, and fecal recoveries when using in situ incubations. Additionally, we evaluated the accuracy of digestibility estimates when using iDM, iNDF, and ADIA. For iDM and iNDF, feed residues demonstrated a BT × IL interaction (P < 0.01). However, fecal residues were only influenced by the main effects of BT and IL (P < 0.01), with the F58 BT and 288-h IL having the greatest residues for both iDM and iNDF. The variation in residues was greatly reduced when using iNDF compared with iDM. Fecal recovery estimates most closely approximated 100% recovery when utilizing ADIA and iDM using the F57 × 576 h incubation method (P < 0.01), although recovery was overestimated for all incubation combinations. Fecal NDF recovery estimates better represented the excretion profiles when the F57 × 576 h combination was used with iDM as the internal marker (P < 0.01). Estimates of DM and NDF digestibility were the most accurate when utilizing ADIA (P < 0.01) relative to all other treatments. Our results indicate that the proper methodological application is specific to the purpose of the inferences. When evaluating fecal recoveries and digestibility, ADIA or iDM with F57 at 576-h in situ incubation provides the greatest accuracy.",0

Previous genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility genes; however, most ASD-associated genes remain undiscovered. This study aimed to examine rare de novo variants to identify genetic risk factors of ASD using whole exome sequencing (WES), functional characterization, and genetic network analyses of identified variants using Korean familial dataset. We recruited children with ASD and their biological parents. The clinical best estimate diagnosis of ASD was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5TM), using comprehensive diagnostic instruments. The final analyses included a total of 151 individuals from 51 families. Variants were identified and filtered using the GATK Best Practices for bioinformatics analysis, followed by genome alignments and annotation to the reference genome assembly GRCh37 (liftover to GRCh38), and further annotated using dbSNP 154 build databases. To evaluate allele frequencies of de novo variants, we used the dbSNP, gnomAD exome v2.1.1, and genome v3.0. We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) software to construct networks using all identified de novo variants with known autism-related genes to find probable relationships. We identified 36 de novo variants with potential relations to ASD; 27 missense, two silent, one nonsense, one splice region, one splice site, one 5′ UTR, and one intronic SNV and two frameshift deletions. We identified six networks with functional relationships. Among the interactions between de novo variants, the IPA assay found that the NF-κB signaling pathway and its interacting genes were commonly observed at two networks. The relatively small cohort size may affect the results of novel ASD genes with de novo variants described in our findings. We did not conduct functional experiments in this study. Because of the diversity and heterogeneity of ASD, the primary purpose of this study was to investigate probable causative relationships between novel de novo variants and known autism genes. Additionally, we based functional relationships with known genes on network analysis rather than on statistical analysis. We identified new variants that may underlie genetic factors contributing to ASD in Korean families using WES and genetic network analyses. We observed novel de novo variants that might be functionally linked to ASD, of which the variants interact with six genetic networks.",0

The specific cause of autism is not well understood yet. However, numerous studies indicated that environmental and genetic factors, dysregulated immune response, and alterations to the balance and content of the gut microbiota are implemented in the development of autism. Many non-pharmacological interventions are nominated to manage autism, including family support services and psychoeducational methods. Moreover, different pharmacological therapy modalities are recommended for children with ASD. Learning more about the brain, immune system, and gut connections could assist in early diagnosis and treatment of this devastating neurodevelopmental disorders as an early intervention in ASD could improve a child's overall development.

Currently, chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers, including PCa, mainly inhibit tumor growth by apoptosis induction. However, defects in apoptotic cellular responses frequently lead to drug resistance, which is the main cause of chemotherapy failure. For this reason, trigger non-apoptotic cell death might represent an alternative approach to prevent drug resistance in cancer. Several agents, including natural compounds, have been shown to induce necroptosis in human cancer cells. In this study we evaluated the involvement of necroptosis in anticancer activity of delta-tocotrienol (δ-TT) in PCa cells (DU145 and PC3). Combination therapy is one tool used to overcome therapeutic resistance and drug toxicity. Evaluating the combined effect of δ-TT and docetaxel (DTX), we found that δ-TT potentiates DTX cytotoxicity in DU145 cells. Moreover, δ-TT induces cell death in DU145 cells that have developed DTX resistance (DU-DXR) activating necroptosis. Taken together, obtained data indicate the ability of δ-TT to induce necroptosis in both DU145, PC3 and DU-DXR cell lines. Furthermore, the ability of δ-TT to induce necroptotic cell death may represent a promising therapeutical approach to overcome DTX chemoresistance in PCa.",0

There is a need to develop novel nanoparticle-based strategies to overcome resistance and improve therapeutic response. Nanomedicine-based strategies include the nanoparticle-/liposome-based delivery of drugs and siRNA to downregulate the genes causing resistance and the use of natural substances such as chemosensitizers to improve response to therapy. Abstract Cancer is the leading cause of economic and health burden worldwide. The commonly used approaches for the treatment of cancer are chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Chemotherapy frequently results in undesirable side effects, and cancer cells may develop resistance. Combating drug resistance is a challenging task in cancer treatment. Drug resistance may be intrinsic or acquired and can be due to genetic factors, growth factors, the increased efflux of drugs, DNA repair, and the metabolism of xenobiotics. The strategies used to combat drug resistance include the nanomedicine-based targeted delivery of drugs and genes using different nanocarriers such as gold nanoparticles, peptide-modified nanoparticles, as well as biomimetic and responsive nanoparticles that help to deliver payload at targeted tumor sites and overcome resistance. Gene therapy in combination with chemotherapy aids in this respect. siRNA and miRNA alone or in combination with chemotherapy improve therapeutic response in tumor cells. Some natural substances, such as curcumin, quercetin, tocotrienol, parthenolide, naringin, and cyclosporin-A are also helpful in combating the drug resistance of cancer cells. This manuscript summarizes the mechanism of drug resistance and nanoparticle-based strategies used to combat it.",0

It is largely considered to be safe when consumed at low doses for attenuating pathophysiology as shown by animal models, in vitro assays, and ongoing human trials. Medical researchers and the allied sciences have experimented with tocotrienols for many decades, but its therapeutic potential was limited to adjuvant or concurrent treatment regimens. Recent studies have focused on targeted drug delivery by enhancing the bioavailability through carriers, self‐sustained emulsions, nanoparticles, and ethosomes. Epigenetic modulation and computer remodeling are other means that will help increase chemosensitivity.

Megestrol acetate (MGA) is insoluble in water and its oral absorption is limited and considerably affected by food. Nanoemulsions (NEs) can be used as effective oral drug delivery systems where the hydrophobic API is loaded into the oil phase. In this study, MGA-loaded NEs were prepared based on the spontaneous emulsification technique. The effects of different excipients such as ethanol, Tween 80, Lipoid E80, and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) on the NEs characterization were investigated. The experimental results indicated that optimum MGA-loaded NEs (F20) were nanometer-sized droplets (166.9 ± 3.0 nm) with negative zeta potential (−12.2 ± 1.1 mV). The effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on characteristic properties of F20 was also evaluated. On the selected NEs, in vitro dissolution tests and stability studies in various mediums and storage conditions were performed. The encapsulation efficiency of NEs were > 99%. The overall droplet size of F20 and PVP-2 (PVP-coated NEs) remained relatively stable as the pH changed from 1.2 to 6.8. It was determined that F20 and PVP-2 remained stable at 4°C until 12 weeks and had higher cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells. To conclude, droplet size, surface charge, and stability are important properties for NEs to have sufficient effectiveness. In this study, alternative oral NEs of low-solubility drug MGA were developed considering the above features.",0

Nebulization offers a promising means of targeting drugs to their site of action in the lung. Research design and methods In the present study, nebulizable oil in water nanoemulsion formulations was co-loaded with naringin/celecoxib and tested for pulmonary administration by different nebulizer types. Results The translucent appearance of nanoemulsion formulations was revealed, with particle size (75–106 nm), zeta potential (−3.42 to −4.86 mV), and controlled in-vitro release profiles for both drugs. The nanoemulsions showed favorable stability profiles and superior cytotoxicity on A549 lung cancer cells. Aerosolization studies on the selected nanoemulsion formulation revealed its high stability during nebulization, with the generation of an aerosol of small volume median diameter and mass median aerodynamic diameter lower than 5 µm. Moreover, it demonstrated considerable safety and bioaccumulation in lung tissues, in addition to accumulation in the brain, liver, and bones, which are the main organs to which lung cancer metastasizes. Conclusions Nanoemulsion proved to be a promising nebulizable system, which paves the way for treatment of pulmonary diseases other than lung cancer.",0

Cisplatin (CP) is a platinum-containing drug with anti-tumor activity against different cancers in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. However, drug resistance has restricted its potential in the treatment of cancer patients. CP can promote levels of free radicals, particularly reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce cell death. Due to the double-edged sword role of ROS in cancer as a pro-survival or pro-death mechanism, ROS can result in CP resistance. In the present review, association of ROS with CP sensitivity/resistance is discussed, and in particular, how molecular pathways, both upstream and downstream targets, can affect the response of cancer cells to CP chemotherapy. Furthermore, anti-tumor compounds, such as curcumin, emodin, chloroquine that regulate ROS and related molecular pathways in increasing CP sensitivity are described. Nanoparticles can provide co-delivery of CP with anti-tumor agents and by mediating photodynamic therapy, and induce ROS overgeneration to trigger CP sensitivity. Genetic tools, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) can down-regulate molecular pathways such as HIF-1α and Nrf2 to promote ROS levels, leading to CP sensitivity. Considering the relationship between ROS and CP chemotherapy, and translating these findings to clinic can pave the way for effective treatment of cancer patients.",0

Hepatotropic viruses can cause liver inflammation that can develop into liver graft fibrosis and cirrhosis over the long term. Immunological reactions due to viral hepatitis infections are associated with or can mimic graft rejection, rendering the condition difficult to manage. Prevention strategies using vaccinations are agreeable to patients, safe, cost-effective and practical. Hence, strategies to eliminate viral hepatitis A and B focus mainly on immunization programmes for children who have received a liver transplant. Although a vaccine has been developed to prevent hepatitis C and E viruses, its use is not licensed worldwide. Consequently, eliminating hepatitis C and E viruses mainly involves early detection in children with suspected cases and effective treatment with antiviral therapy. Good hygiene and sanitation are also important to prevent hepatitis A and E infections. Donor blood products and liver grafts should be screened for hepatitis B, C and E in children who are undergoing liver transplantation. Future research on early detection of viral hepatitis infections should include molecular techniques for detecting hepatitis B and E. Moreover, novel antiviral drugs for eradicating viral hepatitis that are highly effective and safe are needed for children who have undergone liver transplantation.",0

Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) give these patients a chance of virus eradication and safe transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of DAA in KTx and HD patients in real-world settings. Methods Sustained virologic response (SVR) and treatment safety were analyzed in KTx and HD patients from the EpiTer-2 database, which included HCV-infected subjects treated with DAA between 2015 and 2019. Additionally, for KTx patients, changes in creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria within a year after treatment, and changes in the need for calcineurin inhibitors were assessed. Results Among 10,152 patients from the EpiTer-2 database 148 were selected, 85 after KTx and 63 undergoing HD. The most common genotype, 1b HCV, was found in 73% and 86% of patients, respectively. Cirrhosis was noted in 10% and 19%, respectively. The most common DAA regimen after KTx was sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (54%), whereas in HD patients it was ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir +/- dasabuvir (56%). All patients with available follow-up results achieved SVR. No deaths, kidney loss or acute rejection episodes were noted. The most common adverse effects in both groups were anemia and weakness. One year after treatment, creatinine concentration, eGFR and proteinuria remained stable in the majority of patients. Conclusion DAA treatment of HCV infection demonstrated high effectiveness and safety in hemodialyzed patients and patients who had undergone KTx in this real-world study.",0

Methods We prospectively enrolled 17 LT and 11 KT recipients with HCV infection starting a sofosbuvir-based antiviral therapy for 12 weeks. All participants before (T0), 12 (T12), and 24 (T24) weeks after the end of the therapy completed the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire, the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI—Y1–Y2). Results At T0, LT and KT patients were similar for gender, age, BMI, smoking habits, marital status, mean liver stiffness values at Fibroscan, and HCV genotype distribution (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in STAI-Y1, STAI-Y2, Zung, and SF-36 scores (p > 0.05). At T12, all the participants showed a sustained virological response (SVR). All items of the SF-36 questionnaire improved from the pretreatment to posttreatment period within the LT group, and the 4 domains role-physical, bodily pain, social function, role-emotional, and mental health reached statistical significance (p < 0.05 in all cases). On the contrary, in KT patients, there was no significant improvement in SF-36 mean scores compared to at baseline at T12 and T24. Conclusions This pilot study suggested that DAA therapy is associated with a significant improvement of the QoL only in LT recipients. Probably, KT recipients did not consider HCV a “central player” in the course of their disease, and HCV eradication did not significantly impact on their QoL.",0

Thus, we aimed to assess trends in prevalence, health resource utilization and mortality among Medicare beneficiaries with HCV on haemodialysis. This is a retrospective study of outpatient and inpatient claims for Medicare beneficiaries receiving haemodialysis (2005‐2016). A total of 291 663 subjects on haemodialysis were included (67.3 ± 15.2 years, 55% male, 55% white, 49% age‐based eligibility). The prevalence of HCV in subjects on haemodialysis was stable and was significantly higher (mean 4.2% in 2005‐2016, P = 0.50 for the trend) than in subjects not on haemodialysis (<1%). In multivariate analysis, liver cirrhosis (odds ratio = 3.4 (95% CI = 3.3‐3.6)) was an independent predictor of 1‐year mortality among haemodialysis patients. Mean total inpatient payments in dialysis patients with HCV remained stable during 2005 ($73 803) through 2016 ($72 133) (trend P = 0.54) while mean total outpatient payment decreased from 2005 ($53 497) to 2016 ($35 439; trend P = 0.0013). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, gender, race and location, both HCV and cirrhosis remained significant contributors to greater spending [HCV: inpatient +22.1% (+19.2%‐25%), HCV: outpatient +18.4% (+14.6%‐22.2%), cirrhosis: inpatient +59.7% (+56.9%‐62.6%), cirrhosis: outpatient +9.4% (+6.2%‐12.6%)]. In conclusion, HCV‐infected Medicare patients receiving haemodialysis incur greater resource utilization; mortality is higher in patients with cirrhosis only. Although HCV prevalence in Medicare haemodialysis recipients is higher than in patients without haemodialysis, these rates are lower than reported, suggesting potential under‐screening for HCV in this high‐risk population.",0

Examples of nomographs in common current use compute the lift available for a hot-air balloon, the boiling points of solvents under reduced pressure in the chemistry laboratory, and the relative forces in a centrifuge in a biochemical laboratory. Sundials represent another ancient yet widely familiar example. With the advent and ready accessibility of the computer, printed mathematical tables, slide rules and nomographs became generally redundant. However, nomographs provide insight into mathematical relationships, are useful for rapid and repeated application, even in the absence of calculational facilities, and can reliably be used in the field. Many nomographs for various purposes may be found online. This paper describes the origins and development of nomographs, illustrating their use with some relevant examples. A supplementary interactive Excel file demonstrates their application for some simple mathematical operations.",0

Several centrifugation procedures for the separation of membranes involved in myelinogenesis are critically appraised, and guidelines for selection of centrifugation conditions are given. Characteristics of subcellular fractions are presented in the form of electron micrographs; also presented are distribution of RNA and protein; electrophoretic profiles of membrane proteins, and verification of the myelin‐specific basic proteins, proteolipid protein, and glycoprotein by the immuno‐electroblot technique; and the distribution of eight marker enzyme activities. Myelin‐related membranes were found to differ both qualitatively and quantitatively in their complement of myelin‐specific proteins. These myelin‐containing fractions appear to represent different stages of myeli‐nation that coexist in developing mouse brain. These results provide the fundamental methodologies and background information for kinetic radioisotope analysis of intracellular events in the assembly of myelin presented in a companion article.",0

This method avoids the drawbacks of classical purification and isolation methods which involve time‐consuming operations with low resolution and, often, insufficient yields. Excellent overall yields of minor amounts (in the low μg range) using this method allow for sequence determination of yet inaccessible proteins. Solubilized cell proteins of mouse brain were separated by high resolution two‐dimensionalelectrophoresis and electroblotted onto a siliconized glass fiber membrane. The immobilized proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R‐250, and twelve proteins spots were then submitted to both Edman degradation and amino acid analysis. Proteins were identified by comparison of the experimentally determined amino acid composition with a dataset derived from the Protein Identification Resource (PIR) protein sequence database. Eight out of twelve proteins tested were identified by amino acid analysis and confirmed by N‐terminal sequence determination.",0

Pituitary and one preparation of brain FGF (Prep A) contain a basic mitogenic activity, which migrates to the same position on electrophoresis in acid pH gels as detected by incorporation of [methyl- 3H]-thymidine into BALB/c 3T3 cells. In contrast, another preparation of brain FGF (Prep B) contains two mitogens, one (20-30%) indistinguishable from the basic components in pituitary and brain (Prep A) FGF preparations and an acidic activity (70-80%), pl 5-6, that migrates more slowly on acid gels, corresponding to the acidic component of brain FGF described previously (Thomas, K. A., M. C. Riley, S. K. Lemmon, N. C. Baglan, and R. A. Bradshaw. 1980. J. Biol. Chem. 255:5517-5520.) In agreement with that report, none of the mitogens comigrates with fragments of myelin basic protein. Pituitary FGF was virtually inactive, brain (Prep A) FGF had a small amount of activity, and brain (Prep B) FGF was highly potent (50% maximal stimulation at 15-30 ng/ml) in stimulating the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells. The acidic component of brain FGF, which is much more unstable at pH 8.5 than the basic one, can be protected by reducing agents, whereas the basic constituent of brain FGF as well as pituitary FGF is unaffected by reducing conditions. Thus, brain FGF preparations may contain two distinct mitogenic activities, one that is acidic and contains HUVE cell activity, and a basic mitogen that is similar to and may be identical with pituitary FGF.",0

However, transition probabilities, according to which a system switches from the current regime to another one, are commonly designed as a priori known parameters, and their misspecification can degrade the performance of the algorithms filtering (or estimating) latent variables of the system. To overcome the misspecification, the present paper proposes a novel Sequential Monte Carlo procedure for estimating the transition probabilities. More specifically, it extends the concept of Rao-Blackwellization to the Dirichlet distribution, which represents the model of these probabilities. The experiments show that the proposed technique outperforms some of the classical methods in terms of the estimation precision and also the precision stability.",0

We launched this meta-analysis to assess the prognostic value of serum LDH in patients with RCC. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for information on serum LDH and the outcome of RCC through June 14, 2016. The hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were extracted and integrated from the matching studies. Results A total of 29 studies including 6629 patients with RCC were incorporated in this meta-analysis. Patients whose serum LDH levels were elevated had a lower OS (HR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.69–2.69, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the pooled data showed that a higher serum LDH level was a negative prognostic factor for PFS (HR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.48–2.04, P < 0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analyses indicated elevated serum LDH was associated with poor survival in different tumor types. Elevated serum LDH was significantly associated with worse prognosis for patients with all stages of RCC (OS, HR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.09–5.33), metastatic RCC (OS, HR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.57–2.59; CSS, HR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.49–2.15), and non-metastatic RCC (OS, HR = 3.67, CI = 1.33–10.13). Besides, elevated serum LDH also indicated a worse prognosis in subgroups of cut-off values, analysis types and ethnicity. Conclusions Our results show that serum LDH levels are associated with the outcomes of RCC and can be used as a valuable biomarker for monitoring prognoses.",0

Sympathetic neurons from 12- to 14-day-old chick embryos were cultured; the neurons were then stimulated with 50% plasma from eclamptic, preeclamptic, hypertensive, normotensive pregnant, hypertensive, and normotensive nonpregnant women (n=7). Similarly, neurons were individually incubated with mixtures of 50% corresponding plasma with 0.25% bupivacaine or bupivacaine only (n=7). Furthermore, the effects of 1%, 10%, and 50% plasma from eclamptic, preeclamptic, and normotensive pregnant patients (n=7) were also evaluated. Norepinephrine concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Electron microscopic studies of nerve cells were also performed. Stimulation with plasma from eclamptic and preeclamptic women significantly increased norepinephrine concentration (P<0.0001) compared with control. The release of norepinephrine was found to be concentration-dependent. Conversely, norepinephrine secretion was significantly hampered by bupivacaine treatment (P<0.0001). Electron microscopic studies in eclamptic and preeclamptic plasma-stimulated nerve cells showed that perikarya were in close contact with each other and with nerve cell processes. After treatment with bupivacaine, nerve cells were irregular in shape and the cell membranes were demyelinated. These results suggest that eclamptic and preeclamptic plasma has an excitotoxic effect on sympathetic nerve via axoplasmic membrane depolarization, thus increasing norepinephrine secretion that is blocked by bupivacaine. A preeclamptic condition may be improved by depression of sympathetic nerve stimulation.",0

The resultant materials were characterized by N2 sorption and chemical structures by Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy before and after a harsh hydrothermal exposure (550 °C, 75 mol% vapour and 40 h). The cobalt silica materials showed a lower surface area loss from 48% to 12% with increasing Co/Si molar ratio from 0.05 to 0.25 and relatively maintaining their pore size distribution, while pure silica exhibited significant surface area reduction (80%) and pore size broadening. For low cobalt loading sample (Co/Si = 0.05), the cobalt was highly dispersed in the silica network in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen and a small proportion of Co-Co interaction in the second shell. Long range order Co3O4 was observed when Co/Si molar ratio increased to 0.10 and 0.25. The hydrothermal exposure did not affect the local cobalt environments and no cobalt-silicon interaction was observed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The hydrothermal stability of the silica matrix was attributed to the physical barrier of cobalt oxide in opposing densification and silica mobility under harsh hydrothermal conditions.",0

To improve this metric, they developed a serious game application based on an auction-based reward mechanism. The ultimate aim of this approach is to create an incentive structure for software practitioners to find and resolved bugs that are auctioned where participants are encouraged to solve and test more bugs in less time and improve quality of software development in a competitive environment.

Therefore, new strategies need to be devised for cost-effective security provision. In this paper, we motivate the integration of a context-aware security controller into LTE/EPS networks to minimize the overall security cost. This controller activates security mechanisms according to the contextual information such as the application type and the device capabilities.

Hence, the network operators face the challenge to host several categories of subscribers such as static subscribers, subscribers with high mobility, subscribers with small amount of data, etc. With the traditional connectivity management, network mechanisms such as mobility management, QoS control and security mechanisms are designed to be activated in a systematic manner leading to rising the network operating cost. They do not take into consideration the real requirements of each subscriber. For instance, a static subscriber does not need the mobility management mechanisms. Therefore, it is clear that the connectivity management should be tailored to the subscriber context and the network situation. In this paper, we highlight the need for a flexible connectivity management that optimizes network resource usage. As the security is one of the connectivity management key components, we analyze the security implementation in the EPS architecture.

Long Term Evolution (LTE) is one of the most popular 4G technologies defined by 3rd Generation Partnership Projects (3GPP). It is observed that the end user requires two authentication steps to access multimedia services. The first is the LTE network layer authentication, and the second is the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) service layer authentication. The authentication steps utilize energy and are carried out using the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol. This paper proposes an Improved AKA (I-AKA) authentication protocol which authenticates the user on both the network layer and the service layer without double execution the AKA protocol and simplifies the authentication steps. Furthermore, the security and energy consumption were analyzed and the results showed the proposed I-AKA could save up to 81.82% of the terminal's energy consumption related to authentication with increased security.",0

It is inefficient that almost all involved steps in IMS authentication are duplicated. Hence, some one-pass IMS authentications were proposed to increase the efficiency of the IMS authentication. Unfortunately, these protocols have some problems which make them unfeasible. Therefore, we proposed a lightweight one-pass IMS authentication protocol to reduce signaling traffic. Through analysis, we found that it has minimal impact on the network functionality and will not influent the succeeding IMS re-authentication, which makes it more feasible.",0

SSR is based on the on-demand routing with the route request (RREQ) and route reply (RREP) procedure. In SSR, a node measures the signal strength of a received RREQ, and calculate the appropriate data transmission rate. Nodes also calculate the standby time for the RREQ forwarding proportionally to the medium time at the data transmission rate. A RREQ through higher data rate links arrives at the destination earlier, and the destination can select a low delay and high throughput route easily. We evaluate the performance of SSR in terms of delay, throughput and route discovery delay by means of QualNet network simulator. As a result, we show that SSR can discover the lower delay and higher throughput route than the conventional shortest hop routing without increasing control overhead in multi-rate ad hoc networks.",0

The best approach to assess patient prognosis relies on prediction models that simultaneously consider a number of prognostic factors and provide an estimate of patients’ absolute risk of an event. Such prediction models should be characterized by adequately discriminating between patients who will have an event and those who will not and by adequate calibration ensuring accurate prediction of absolute risk. This Users’ Guide will help clinicians understand the available metrics for assessing discrimination, calibration, and the relative performance of different prediction models. This article complements existing Users’ Guides that address the development and validation of prediction models. Together, these guides will help clinicians to make optimal use of existing prediction models.",0

In this paper, we fundamentally adopt and construct the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to improve end-to-end delay and maximum link utilisation (MLU) in a wireless All-IP access network. In an experimental pseudo setting, we propose a routing method DRL-MPR (Multi-Plane Routing) within a Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN) framework as a controller in which by simultaneously allocating multiple robust IP sessions, each session will take the near optimal path/plane. We first revisit Multi-Plane Routing Protocol (MPR) to configure a set of routing paths/Routing Planes (RP) from a physical topology as pre-condition ahead of the traffic injection. We compare our decision making scheme results with some traditional routing methodologies such as OSPF and standard Multi-Plane Routing (MPR). Our simulation results show that DRL obtains lower maximum link utilisation (MLU) and end-to-end delay. For example, in the 19 nodes and 41 links topology, a small traffic load results in 60% maximum link utilisation for DRL-MPR, whereas those of OSPF and MPR are 100% and 94% respectively. In this simulation environment, the traffic demand in the IP access network is gradually increasing to the point of saturated network link utilisation.",0

Conventional heuristic solutions like Weighted-Cost Multi-Path (WCMP) and Local Shortest Queue (LSQ) are less flexible to the changing workload distributions and arrival rates, with a poor balance among multiple load balancers. The cooperative network load balancing task is formulated as a Dec-POMDP problem, which naturally induces the MARL methods. To bridge the reality gap for applying learning-based methods, all models are directly trained and evaluated on a real-world system from moderate- to large-scale setups. Experimental evaluations show that the independent and ""selfish'' load balancing strategies are not necessarily the globally optimal ones, while the proposed MARL solution has a superior performance over different realistic settings. Additionally, the potential difficulties of the application and deployment of MARL methods for network load balancing are analysed, which helps draw the attention of the learning and network communities to such challenges.",0

Hence, this study aimed to further explore the relationship between lnc-ANGPTL1-3 and miR-30a and their linkage with disease properties and prognosis in bortezomib-treated MM patients. Methods: Fifty-nine MM patients underwent treatment with the bortezomib-based regimen, and 30 healthy donors were consecutively enrolled. Bone marrow samples were collected from MM patients (before therapy) and healthy donors; then, plasma cells were separated for lnc-ANGPTL1-3 and miR-30a detection by RT-qPCR. Then treatment response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of MM patients were assessed. Results: Lnc-ANGPTL1-3 was upregulated while miR-30a was downregulated in MM patients compared to healthy donors (both P < 0.001), then a negative correlation between lnc-ANGPTL1-3 and miR-30a was found in MM patients (P < 0.001) instead of in health donors (P = 0.188). In MM patients, lnc-ANGPTL1-3 correlated with increased t (4;14) (P = 0.033), Del (17p) (P = 0.018), ISS stage (P = 0.020), R-ISS stage (P = 0.025) but not t (14;16) (P = 0.255) or Durie-Salmon stage (P = 0.186); while miR-30a only related to decreased t (14;16) (P = 0.025) and R-ISS stage (P = 0.006). Besides, lnc-ANGPTL1-3 predicted lower complete response (CR) (P = 0.034), poor PFS (P = 0.016) and OS (P = 0.041) but not objective response rate (ORR) (P = 0.128). However, miR-30a forecasted higher CR (P = 0.013), prolonged PFS (P = 0.014), and OS (P = 0.045) but not ORR (P = 0.407). Conclusion: Lnc-ANGPTL1-3 negative correlates with miR-30a, which links with key cytogenetic features, ISS/R-ISS stage, and prognosis in MM patients who underwent treatment of bortezomib-based regimen.",0

We now possess a certain amount of information about these two levels of description, stored in libraries, databases and ontologies. A current challenge is to bridge the gap between topology and function, i.e. developing quantitative models aimed at characterizing the expression patterns of large sets of genes. However, approaches that work well for small networks become impossible to master at large scales, mainly because parameters proliferate. In this review we discuss the state of the art of large-scale functional network models, addressing the issue of what can be considered as ""realistic"" and what the main limitations may be. We also show some directions for future work, trying to set the goals that future models should try to achieve. Finally, we will emphasize the possible benefits in the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying complex multifactorial diseases, and in the development of novel strategies for the description and the treatment of such pathologies.",0
